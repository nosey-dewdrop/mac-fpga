# Patch notes

## 1.2 (in progress, from 24 September 2026)

Every update below comes with the tests that prove it: what each test checks, and the numbers before and after.

### #1 · The CLI and the guide say the same thing · 24 September

**`dewfpga uninstall` says what it removes, and removes only its own.** It used to print
`removing: ~/fpga ~/.dewfpga <link>` and then delete five entries inside `~/fpga`, not the folder.
It also deleted Homebrew's `dewfpga` link even when that link pointed to another copy of the CLI.
Now it lists every path it deletes, touches the link only when the link points to itself, leaves
anything else in `~/fpga` alone, and says `nothing to remove` when there is nothing.
Tried on a fake install with a student project inside `~/fpga`: the project file survived, the real
Homebrew link survived, a second run printed `nothing to remove`, and an empty folder was removed.

**Version 1.2.0.** The CLI had said 0.1.0 since 19 September. The patch number and
`dewfpga --version` are now the same number.

**The guide stopped contradicting itself.**
- Section 2 said two course-code problems "are handled for you". Only one is (the seven-segment
  port line); the others stop the build with the line and the fix.
- Section 7 said "one", then "two more", then listed six cases.
- Section 8 called it "the one case hit so far".
- The command list had no `--version`.

Tried: writing the right count into section 7. Dropped it, because the list grows every time a new
student repo turns up a new case. The text now says what each case does instead of how many there are.
The HTML page and the PDF (12 pages) were rebuilt from the same source.

**README.tr described rules that stopped being true on 21 September.** It said the top module is
chosen by its `.xdc` file, `sim` needs `<top>_tb.sv`, two `.sv` files in one folder is an error, and
`dewfpga check` has six rows. The top now comes from the module hierarchy, the testbench is
recognized by its content, file names are free, and `check` prints nine rows.
README.tr is now a translation of the English README.

**Disk space, measured.**
- After the one-line install, `~/fpga` holds 1.40 GB: nextpnr-xilinx 1.06 GB, prjxray 214 MB,
  the chip database 89 MB, the Python venv 52 MB.
- Homebrew packages add 235 MB.
- The home page said 1.76 GB, which is the by-hand path with full git clones.
- The home, why and Turkish pages now say 1.4 GB (1.76 GB by hand).

**Tests.** `test/run.sh`: 51 passed, 0 failed before the change (81 s) and 51 passed, 0 failed
after. One test was renamed: "top found from xdc" is now "top found from the hierarchy", which is
what it has checked since 21 September.

**Not done here.** The README still says "46 checks"; update #6 locks that number to the test suite.

### #2 · 132 SystemVerilog probes run through the product, every stage checked · 25–26 September

**In numbers.** Before #2, `test/run.sh` passed 51 checks, and the 43 probes of the 2509 measurement lived
outside the repo, run by a script that called yosys directly (33 of 43 synthesized). After: `test/run.sh`
passes 178, fails 0, and counts 87 known gaps apart; its probe section runs 132 probes through the CLI
itself. Synthesis 69/132, all four stages 30/132, and 29 of the 111 probes Vivado supports pass all four:
the other 82 are our gap. 17 probes build a bitstream whose netlist fails: 15 do something else (a silent
wrong), and 2 (`35`, an MMCM, and `97`, a block RAM) have no simulation model to check them against. The
product did not change in #2 (`bin/` and `templates/` are the same as before); #3 and #4 are scored
against these numbers. Seven break rounds sent 195 reports; every one was reproduced (one of round 7's in
part), seven side claims inside them did not hold (below), and what was not fixed here is listed with the
update that owns it. Every probe, with its construct, Vivado's status, the source and the stage that fails, is listed under
"Every probe" below.

**What a student may write is now part of the test suite.** `test/sv/` holds 132 probes, one construct
each: `design.sv` (one probe has `design.v`) with `module top`, `tb.sv` with `module tb` that prints
`PASS`, sometimes a `.svh`, a `.mem`, a package, interface, submodule or netlist-form module in its own
`.sv`, or the lab's own `Basys3_Master.xdc` with only some pins uncommented (`96b`; `93`'s one design file
is `counter.sv`, as its lab has it). 43 came from the 2509 measurement (`svprobe`); the comments that named
a student and a student's file are gone. 8 were added in the first break round, 18 in the second, 23 in
the third, 8 in the fourth, 15 in the fifth, 8 in the sixth and 9 in the seventh (below), for cases the 43
did not cover. Every probe goes
through four stages, all of them through `bin/dewfpga` and `templates/Makefile`, in a temp folder that
holds only the probe's sources:
- **rtl**: `dewfpga sim`. Pass = exit 0 and the testbench printed `PASS`.
- **synth**: `dewfpga bit`, with the whole `Basys3_Master.xdc` uncommented as in a lab folder. Pass = the
  product wrote `top.json`, or the netlist of another module when the CLI took that one for the top
  (round 4: `81`); the stages then check what it built, and the row's note names it.
- **netlist**: that netlist written back as Verilog (`read_json`, `write_verilog`). Pass = both:
  - the same `tb.sv`, simulated on the netlist with yosys' `xilinx/cells_sim.v`, prints `PASS`;
  - the netlist matches the RTL (`test/sv/eqv.py`): both get the same inputs, every combination (all
    zeros included) when the design has 16 input bits or fewer, buttons included, and no clock; otherwise
    4096 random cycles, each one all zeros, all ones, mostly zeros, mostly ones or even odds, with the
    buttons pressed one cycle in eight. Every output bit the RTL knows has to be equal; an `x` or a `z` in
    the netlist is not equal. Both start as the board does: a register without a start value gets its
    primitive's default in the netlist (0, or 1 for FDSE and FDPE, as nextpnr writes them) and the same
    value in the RTL, and with a clock and buttons every button is held for one clock edge before the
    first compare, as a student presses reset after loading the board (round 4; round 3 counted such
    differences apart instead, which let a lost reset through); since round 7 so is every input bit
    that resets a register (`sw[15]` in `if (sw[15]) s <= IDLE`). The run also passes when the netlist
    follows, at every compare, a second copy of the RTL started as `dewfpga sim` starts it, `x` where
    it gives no start value: equal to the board's start while a register bit of that copy is still
    `x`, and to that copy, every bit known, once none is. The board then shows what the student's own
    simulation shows (round 6: a register yosys moves into a ROM can start the board one clock off the
    usual 0; round 7 made this one decision for the whole run, not one per compare). When iverilog
    cannot compile the RTL
    (`13d`, `18b`, `18c`, `21b`, `22`, `38`, `54`, `55`, `71`, `72`, `73` today) this half is skipped and the
    result line says so. `test/sv/eqv.sh` runs this half, and `test/sv/eqv_check.sh` runs the same `eqv.sh`
    on netlists that differ from their RTL in one known way (round 5; until then it kept its own copy of
    the RTL side).

  This stage checks what synthesis made. It does not check place-and-route or the bitstream.
- **bit**: the same `dewfpga bit` exits 0 and writes the netlist's `.bit` (`top.bit`).

`test/sv/expect.tsv` has one row per probe: the construct, whether Vivado accepts it, the source for that,
what each stage does today, and what the student sees. `test/sv/run.sh` fails on any difference, in both
directions: a stage that stops passing, and a stage that starts passing without the table saying so. It
also fails on a row without a source, on a `file:line` in the today column that no stage printed, and on a
message the today column quotes (`'...'` or `"..."`) that no stage printed word for word (round 4). It
prints four numbers: synthesis, all four stages, Vivado-supported probes that pass all four, and known
gaps. A known gap does what the table says, but either Vivado supports it and a stage fails, or its
bitstream builds while its netlist fails (a silent wrong).

`test/run.sh` runs it and prints one line per probe: `PASS`, `GAP` (counted on its own, not as a pass;
it does not fail the run) or `FAIL`. A probe that fails where Vivado refuses the code, or where what
Vivado does is unverified, is a `PASS`, unless its bitstream builds from a netlist that fails: that
silent wrong is a `GAP` whatever Vivado does (`03`, `03b`, `05` and `39` are unverified and gaps; this
said `PASS` until round 5, and so did `test/run.sh`'s header). CI runs the same and keeps the rows as the
`sv-results` artifact.
With the measured yosys and iverilog, when #3 or #4 closes a gap the run fails until `expect.tsv` records
the new result, so every change in these numbers is an edit of the table. With another yosys (CI installs
0.68+post) a stage that starts passing is only a note, so the table is updated from a local run.

**Found on the way: the CLI's top finder misses an array of instances.** `inv u_inv [3:0] (...)` is in
UG901's list of supported Verilog, and it compiles through the CLI. What fails is the automatic top: the
scanner does not read `inv u_inv [3:0] (` as an instance, so `inv` looks like a second top, and
`dewfpga bit` prints `2 modules could be the top (nothing instantiates them): inv, top. Name it:  dewfpga
bit inv`, which names the wrong one. `dewfpga bit top` builds it (4 LUT), and so does plain `dewfpga bit`
when the file is named `top.sv`. The old runner called yosys directly and never saw this, so synthesis
through the product is 32/43, not the 33/43 the plan started from. The fix is #4's.

**The Vivado column, checked row by row.** Sources: UG901 v2023.2 (chapter, table, page), UG953 v2022.2
(the 7-series primitive guide), and Vivado logs from public CS223 lab repos. A quoted log line keeps the
message; the student's module and signal names are replaced by a description. A forum is marked as a weak
source. The 132: 111 supported, 3 not supported, 18 unverified (the 123 of round 6: 105, 3, 15; the
115 of round 5: 99, 3, 13; the 100 of round 4: 84, 3, 13). Changes
from the 2509 measurement:
- `35_mmcm`: unverified → supported. UG953 p.459, MMCME2_BASE: "Instantiation: Yes".
- `37_var_init`: supported → unverified. The declaration initializer is documented (UG901 p.244). For
  `initial c2 = 9`, UG901 contradicts itself: p.251 says "initial blocks are ignored during synthesis",
  p.155 initializes a RAM inside an `initial` loop.
- `33`, `33b` (inout read-back): UG953 p.386, IOBUF "Inference: Recommended", added next to UG901
  Tristates, which only covers output buffers.
- `32` (a derived clock): a Vivado 2020.1 lab log where a toggled register clocks another module, 0
  errors, bitstream written.
- The 2509 notes used v2022.2 chapter numbers next to v2023.2 tables; all cites are now v2023.2.
- `42_streaming_concat`: supported → not supported (round 3): its `{<<{...}}` is the "Re-ordering of the
  generic stream: Not Supported" row (p.287), not the "Concatenation of stream_expressions" row above it.
- Still unverified: `03`, `03b` (async load), `04` (both clock edges), `05` (two drivers), `37` (above), and
  of the new ones `39` (an undeclared name; IEEE 1800 makes it an error), `55` (a conditional between two
  values of one enum), and from round 3 `46` (`continue`), `48` (`iff`), `66` (`alias`), `77` (an
  `initial` that reads a signal) and `80` (a statement after an async reset's if/else), from round 4
  `63` (a cast of a real parameter, below), from round 6 `37b` and `63b`, and from round 7 `95` (a module
  with ports and no body), `98` (a module named `INV`) and `99` (a parameter of type `string`). The only sources
  for 04 and 05 are forum posts. `13b` (an unpacked array port) was unverified until the second break
  round found UG901's own examples of it; it is supported now.

**Tried, and why it changed.**
- Calling yosys directly with the Makefile's script, as the old runner did. Dropped: it hid the top
  finder's miss on `26`, and it would not measure #3 and #4, which change the product.
- Uncommenting `create_clock` too. A probe without a `clk` port then prints `create_clock: target
  [get_ports clk] matched nothing`. It stays commented; timing is checked at 100 MHz, as for any lab
  without one.
- Bash 3.2 (macOS's `/bin/bash`) has no `mapfile` and fails on empty arrays under `set -u`; the runner
  uses neither.
- The netlist of `03b` never reaches `$finish`; it used to show as "(no output)". It now says `TIMEOUT`.
- CI installs yosys 0.68+post, while `expect.tsv` is measured with 0.69+post. With the measured yosys and
  iverilog, every difference fails. With other versions, a stage that used to pass and now fails counts,
  and so does a new silent wrong; a new pass is printed as a note, because students get whatever brew
  ships. Before pushing, all 51 were run with yosys 0.68 (YoWASP, in a scratch venv, brew untouched): the
  same 51 results.

**Break round 1.** Three independent breakers (a student who writes what Vivado accepts, a mutation
tester, a regression reader) ran against #2 and sent 38 reports; some are the same break seen by two or
three of them. Every one was reproduced in a scratch folder. Two side claims inside them did not hold as
written: one breaker counted 20 probes hidden behind `passed 94`, and the table has 18 (43 minus the 25
that passed all four; 13 of them Vivado-supported, as the breaker said); another's aside, that CI's golden
check would also miss every LUT INIT zeroed before nextpnr, came from reading `test/run.sh`, and it was not
run under CI's yosys 0.68 (not verified). What changed:
- **The netlist stage passed wrong netlists.** With one to four vectors per testbench, 142 of the
  breaker's 174 single-bit LUT INIT flips in the product's own netlists passed. The netlist is now also
  compared with the RTL (`eqv.py`, above): 204 of 228 such draws were caught (some draws were the same
  flip; round 2 measured distinct flips, under "Does the suite catch breakage?").
- **Testbenches did not look at the construct they name.** `30` passed with `>>>` read as `>>` and with
  `$signed` dropped, `19` with a casez item deleted, `18` could not tell `1???` from `10??`, and `17`'s
  size cast could be dropped because the output cut the value anyway. `17`, `18`, `19` and `30` now check
  every input combination they use against a reference written in plain integers; `30` shows the sign
  that `>>>` copies in (`seg[6] = sh[7]`), and `17` shifts after the cast so the cast shows. The same sweep
  found `10`'s DONE state and `32`'s hex table half unchecked; both testbenches now walk every state and
  every digit, and `18b` and `22` (where only the testbench checks the netlist) check every combination.
  Source mutations over the 43 (one operator at a time, iverilog): 113 killed and 42 survived before,
  122 killed and 32 survived after. The 32 left are equivalent (a 1-bit counter's `+1` and `-1`, widths
  the output cuts anyway, a `generate` branch that is never built, a case item that repeats the
  default), clock-edge swaps and reset phases a testbench cannot see, `led` bits no testbench reads, and
  one logic change its vectors miss (`36`'s `sw[0] & sw[1]` as `|`). A reader fault in any of those
  outputs would still show in the netlist stage, where `eqv.py` compares every output bit.
- **Silent wrongs had no probe, and one was new.** `39_undeclared_name`: `summ` for `sum` builds a
  0-LUT bitstream with exit 0 (the plan's #3 lists it; the table had no row). `23c_package_own_file`:
  the CLI hands the tools only the files that hold a module, so a package in its own file is left out,
  yosys makes `cfg_pkg::MAGIC` an undriven implicit wire, and the bitstream builds with 0 LUT. `eqv.py`
  found a fifth: `03`'s async load. While `btnC` is held, the netlist follows `sw` and the RTL keeps the
  value from the edge, so the board does not do what the simulation showed.
- **Constructs Vivado accepts that the 43 did not cover**, now probes with their sources: `38` gate
  primitives driving `logic` (a Vivado 2015.2 lab log builds it; iverilog 13 refuses it), `16c` UG901's
  own while-loop example (yosys refuses it), `22b` an interface in its own file (iverilog stops at the
  interface port, and the CLI leaves `sum_if.sv` out of synthesis, so yosys does not find the interface),
  `23d` an import in the module header (the CLI refuses it before any tool runs), `40` a module named
  `display` next to a `$display` call (the CLI reads it as an unnamed instance), `13b` an unpacked array
  port (yosys refuses it; Vivado support found in round 2).
- **The runner could be fooled.** It copied build outputs left in a probe folder with fresh times, so
  `make` reused a stale `top_sim`; it now copies only sources. With a yosys other than the measured one
  (CI's 0.68), a probe that turned into a silent wrong was only a note; that now fails in every mode. A
  row with an empty source went through; it is now refused. The table said "the CLI names the line" and
  nothing checked it; a `file:line` in the today column now has to appear in the stage logs, so a latch
  error moved to line 1 fails `01`.
- **`test/run.sh` counted known gaps as passes**: `passed 94` included 18 probes that fail a stage as
  recorded, 13 of them Vivado-supported. They are now `GAP` lines, counted apart.
- **Hygiene.** The personal-path check excluded every file named `run.sh`, so it never read
  `test/sv/run.sh`; it now excludes only `test/run.sh` itself. `expect.tsv` quoted four module and signal
  names from one student's Vivado logs, two of them found in only one repo of the 94; the quotes keep
  the log message and describe the name instead, and a check refuses a quoted `module '<name>'` again.
  `SV_OUT=rows.tsv` (a relative path) wrote into the temp folder and was deleted; it is now made absolute
  before the tests `cd` anywhere.
- **The notes were wrong in five places**, corrected above and below: `-g2005` did not turn only `09`
  and `10` red; the netlist stage does not see the bitstream; the array-of-instances quote was
  paraphrased and the construct does build with `dewfpga bit top`; "no UNISIM models" was given as the
  reason for `18b` and `22`; "these numbers move on their own" contradicted the runner. `35`'s UG901 page
  is 232, not 231. `CLAUDE.md` said the suite has 51 tests.

Tried, and dropped:
- Comparing netlist `x` with a known RTL bit as a mismatch: an uninitialized flip-flop in the netlist
  model is `x` where the RTL has a 2-state `int` at 0 (`10`), and the board starts at 0. An `x` there was
  counted apart and a `z` still counted. Round 3 found that this let an undriven output through, and
  changed it (below).
- Changing all inputs at once in the equivalence bench: `09`'s latch got its gate and data in the same
  instant, a race in any simulator, and showed a false mismatch. Then a random walk of one bit per cycle:
  no race, but `29`'s shift register saw almost only runs of equal bits, and 4 of 12 LUT flips survived.
  Now every bit gets a new random value each cycle, one bit at a time: 20 of 20 in a new sample.
- Decoding the bitstream back to FASM (prjxray's `bit2fasm`) to check the bit stage: it needs `bitread`,
  which `install.sh` does not build, and a frames-to-FASM decode of `30` gave 195 missing and 1939 extra
  features next to nextpnr's FASM (default bits and pseudo-pips), so it is no quick check. A test that
  looks inside the bitstream is left to #6. Until then, place-and-route and bitstream writing are
  checked only by `test/run.sh`'s golden blink FASM, and exactly only with the yosys it was made with.
- A probe for a design and its testbench in one file, and one for two testbenches in one folder: the
  runner keeps the testbench in `tb.sv`, so neither fits a probe; they are left with their fixes (below).

Found and left to later updates (reproduced, not fixed here):
- #3: editing a `.mem` file does not rebuild (`$(TOP).json` does not depend on it), so `dewfpga bit` says
  "up to date" and the board gets the old ROM.
- #4: gate primitives on `logic` in sim; a package or an interface in its own file (and the README and
  cli page sentence "Every .sv/.v in the folder is synthesized", false for them; round 4 made it say what
  happens); an import in the module
  header; a module named `display`; a design and its testbench in one file (sim: "already declared",
  bit: yosys reads the testbench); while loops; unpacked array ports; the unnamed-instance errors come
  out in a different order from run to run (a Python set).
- #5: `04` and an async reset with a synchronous clear in one `always_ff` get "a signal is written from two
  always blocks" with no file:line.
- #6: a test that looks inside the bitstream.
- #12: two testbenches in one folder; `sim` always runs the first, with no way to pick the other.

**Break round 2.** The same three kinds of breaker ran against the tree after round 1 and sent 30
reports; two of them are the same break (`13b`). Each was run in a scratch folder: all 30 reproduced.
Fixed here:
- **`13b`'s Vivado column was wrong.** UG901's own 3D RAM examples declare unpacked array ports:
  `rams_sp_3d.sv` (p.161) has `input [A_WID-1:0] addr [NUM_RAMS-1:0]` and `output reg [D_WID-1:0] dout
  [NUM_RAMS-1:0]`, the dual-port ones (p.162, p.164) the same, and so does v2022.2. `dewfpga bit` on
  UG901's file stops at `rams_sp_3d.sv:10: ERROR: syntax error, unexpected '['`, and `test/run.sh` printed
  `PASS` for it. `13b` is supported now, so a known gap.
- **Vivado accepts 18 more things we fail, and no probe had them.** Each is a probe now, with its source.
  (Round 3 read the sources again: `42` is not supported and `46`, `48` and `55` are unverified, so 14 of
  these 18 count as Vivado-supported now.)
  - UG901 v2023.2 Table 27 marks these Supported, and yosys refuses each at synthesis: `41` `==?`, `42`
    `{<<{...}}`, `43` `foreach`, `44` `do ... while`, `47` a type parameter, `48` `@(posedge clk iff en)`,
    `49` a default argument, `50` arguments by name, `51` an unpacked array `localparam` set with `'{...}`.
    `45` `break` and `46` `continue` are "Jump statements: Not Recommended", the reading `16b` uses for
    `return`. iverilog refuses `42`, `48` and `51` too.
  - `52` an internal tristate bus, the textbook's mux from two tristate buffers. UG901 p.86: "An inferred
    BUFT is converted automatically to logic realized in LUTs". yosys keeps two `$_TBUF_` cells, nextpnr
    has no place for them, and the CLI says "the design does not fit the XC7A35T ... Make it smaller" for
    four muxes. It was then the only probe whose synthesis passes and bitstream fails; round 3 added `70`
    and `75`, which do too.
  - `53` an async reset ORed with a synchronous clear, `always_ff @(posedge clk, posedge btnC) if (btnC ||
    btnU)`: a Vivado 2021.2 lab log builds it; yosys stops ("Multiple edge sensitive events").
  - `54` a name used before its declaration: in the course's own example project, Vivado's simulator
    warns ("VRFC 10-756 ... used before its declaration") and builds; `dewfpga sim` refuses it,
    `dewfpga bit` builds it.
  - `56` a file-scope `typedef enum {S0, S1, S2}`: `S0` collides with a name in yosys' own
    `xilinx/cells_sim.v`, and the only location printed is that yosys file. Inside the module, or named
    `IDLE`/`RUN`/`DONE`, it builds.
  - `57` a course "ready module" in the netlist form the course hands out (`(* keep_hierarchy *)`,
    `\<const0>`, LUT primitives): Vivado 2017.3 builds the course's own example project with two of
    them; the CLI calls the file a leftover Vivado netlist and says to delete it. yosys given the files
    builds it. Of the 7 corpus lab folders the CLI refuses as netlists, 5 hold such course modules (round
    5: 4 of the 5 are one repo's copy of the course's handout folder, 1 is a student's project with the
    modules copied in).
  - `08b` the course's port line with comments in the port list (one after `seg,`, one holding a `;`):
    the port-line fix misses it and yosys stops with "Module port `\dp' is neither input nor output".
  - `55` a conditional between two values of one enum (`next = sw[0] ? RUN : IDLE`): iverilog wants a
    cast, yosys builds it, slang accepts it. What Vivado does is unverified.

  Every new testbench was run twice: it passes on a correct implementation (iverilog on the RTL, or,
  where iverilog refuses, a netlist from yosys-slang or yosys) and fails on the design with its
  construct broken (one edit each, 18 of 18 caught).
- **`eqv.py` never compared the all-zero input.** Its Gray-code walk ran `i = 1 .. 2^n`, so `sw = 0000`
  never came up (and `2^n` truncated to a repeat). A netlist wrong only at `sw = 0000` passed with
  "1048576 output bits compared". The walk starts at 0 now.
- **`eqv.py` missed faults at corner values.** Random cycles drew even odds per bit, so `sw = ffff` came
  up once in 65536 cycles. The breaker's flip in `21`'s popcount LUT (wrong only at `sw = ffff`) passed
  4096 cycles; a second flip, wrong at `sw = 7fff`, too. Each random cycle now picks all zeros, all
  ones, one bit in eight, seven in eight, or even odds; both flips are caught.
- **Buttons turned the exhaustive walk off**, which the notes did not say. Without a clock the walk
  changes one bit at a time anyway, so buttons join it (only `05` has buttons and no clock).
- **`eqv.py` could be gutted with every test green** (compare only bit 0, or run 16 cycles), and the
  round-1 "204 of 228" was a one-off measurement. `test/sv/eqv_check.sh` now runs six netlists that
  differ from their RTL in one known way: equal (has to pass), only `led[15]`, only at `sw = 0000`, a
  clocked design only at `sw = ffff`, only at `sw = 7fff`, and a counter only after 200 cycles.
  `test/run.sh` runs all six.
- **`test/run.sh` trusted the runner's verdict and ignored its exit code.** A runner that wrote `ok` for
  a failing probe, or a consumer that filed `bad` as a gap, left the suite green over a real regression
  (`14`'s parameterized instance hidden from the top finder: `PASS sv 14_params`, exit 0). Now each
  row's verdict is worked out again from `expect.tsv` and the row's four stages and has to match; the
  runner's exit code has to fit its rows; its known-gap count has to equal the rows'.
- **Runner guards that no test pinned**, each now pinned by a check that breaks it on a copy:
  - a testbench that prints `FAIL` (dewfpga sim still exits 0) has to be an rtl fail (`16c` broken on
    purpose);
  - a probe folder without a row has to be refused;
  - a `dewfpga bit` that exits 0 without `top.bit` has to be a bit fail;
  - synth is read from `top.json`, not the exit code: `52` pins it (synth passes, bit fails);
  - a silent wrong of an unverified probe (`03`, `03b`, `05`, `39`) has to stay a gap: the re-derived
    verdict above pins it.
- **The vivado column was not checked against its source.** Changing `01` to `not supported` turned its
  gap into a pass. The runner now refuses a row whose column its source does not back: `not supported`
  needs UG901's "...: Not Supported'" or invalid code, `unverified` needs the reason no source settles it
  ("does not say what Vivado does", "is not described", "Weak source only", "No Vivado log",
  "contradicts itself"), and `supported` has neither. Tried on 9 column-only edits (`01` both ways,
  `22b`, `23b`, `05`, `20`, `18`, `06`, `13b`): all 9 refused.
- **The student-name check had no self-test**, and only knew quoted `module 'x'` forms. It is now a
  function over the source column (the today column names the probes' own modules), it also sees
  `` `\name' `` quotes and Vivado's `(name_reg)`, and a check plants both and has to find them.
- **`expect.tsv` said `03` and `05` build "with no warning".** Both print yosys warnings (`Async reset
  value ... is not constant!`, `Driver-driver conflict ... Resolved using constant.`) and exit 0. Fixed.
- **The notes were wrong**: `22b` is not refused "before any tool runs" (iverilog and yosys both run);
  the LUT-flip counts drew flips with replacement and the survivor list added up to 23, not 24 (now
  measured again, below). `CLAUDE.md`'s corpus line said none of the 73 failing folders was the CLI's
  fault; 17 are Vivado-accepted code we refuse, and 5 of the netlist folders are course modules.

Tried, and dropped:
- Checking new testbenches on slang netlists only: slang refuses `44` ("unsupported language feature"),
  `53` ("condition cannot be matched to any signal from the event list"), `54` (it enforces declaration
  before use) and `57` (no cell library), and its netlist of `52` leaves the bus `x`. Those were checked
  on iverilog or yosys instead.
- Re-deriving the verdict in `test/run.sh` alone: the runner's own verdict was then still unpinned (a
  runner that writes `ok` for `bad` went unnoticed, because the consumer caught the probe anyway). The
  row check now also needs the runner's row to say `bad`. A separate branch for "stages differ" turned
  out to duplicate the verdict comparison (breaking it changed nothing); the two are one branch now.
- A keyword check for `supported` rows: their sources share no phrase (Table 27 rows, coding examples,
  attribute pages, logs), so only the two directions that hide a gap are checked.
- A probe for a module defined in two files, and for a rebuild after a file is deleted or an included
  `.v` changes: the runner copies each probe into a fresh folder, so no probe can see a rebuild. They go
  to #3 with their fix and its test.
- A probe for CRLF line endings: no stage looks at line endings. Left to #4 with the port-line fix.

Found and left to later updates (reproduced, not fixed here):
- #3: a module defined in two files: the scanner keeps the last file that defines it, so a backup
  (`lab4_old.sv`) is built instead of `lab4.sv` (0 LUT, exit 0), and `dewfpga sim` compiles the backup;
  3 of the 89 corpus lab folders define a module in both a `.sv` and a `.v` file (a fourth does it in a
  Vivado netlist, which the CLI already refuses). `dewfpga sim` and `bit` do not rebuild when a file is
  deleted or swapped (a deleted testbench keeps running) or when an `include`d `.v` changes (`bit` says
  "up to date"): the same class as round 1's `.mem`.
- #4: the 18 new constructs, `13b`, and in sim `54` and `55`; the port-line fix with comments (`08b`);
  `--fix-ports` rewrites every CRLF line ending of the file it fixes (15 of the 364 corpus `.sv`/`.v`
  files are CRLF); the course's netlist-form modules refused as leftovers (`57`).
- #5: `52`'s "does not fit ... Make it smaller" for `$_TBUF_` cells; `53`'s "two always blocks"
  advice for one always block. The guide's section 7 says the async-load reset and the dual-edge cases
  "both stop with the line and the fix" (`03` builds with warnings, `04` has no file:line), quotes a
  netlist message ("take the original .sv") the CLI does not print, and section 8 says section 7
  "lists the cases hit so far" (it lists 5; the probes record 37 Vivado-supported failures). #3 turns
  `03` into an error; the catalog is #5's.
- #6: the pnr line prints a garbled clock name when the net's name has a `:` in it (`03`: `416:
  emulate_split_set_clr$1652.C': 338.98 MHz`).

**Break round 3.** The same three kinds of breaker ran against the tree after round 2 and sent 25
reports. Each was run in a scratch folder: all 25 reproduced. Fixed here:
- **Vivado accepts 20 more things, and no probe had them.** Each is a probe now (`58` to `80`), with its
  source. Every new testbench passes on a correct design (iverilog on the RTL, or, where iverilog refuses
  it, a hand-written equivalent) and fails on the design with its construct broken (28 edits, 28 caught).
  - Two new silent wrongs. `58` a hierarchical name, `assign led[1:0] = u_fsm.state;` (UG901 Table 20
    p.239, Table 27 p.288: Supported): yosys makes `u_fsm.state` a 1-bit implicit wire with no driver, so
    `led[1]` is a constant 0 and `led[0]` is undriven, and the bitstream builds (exit 0) while `dewfpga sim`
    shows the state. (This said "with the state LEDs dark" until round 4; what an undriven LED shows was
    not measured.) `59`
    `$isunknown(sw)` (Table 21 p.240): yosys makes it the constant 1, so the LED is lit for every input.
  - UG901 rows marked Supported that yosys refuses at synthesis: `60` pass by reference, `61` enum ranges
    (`{S[3]}`, `{T[5:7]}`), `62` the type operator, `63` `int'(STEP)` of a real parameter, `64` an unpacked
    struct, `65` a streaming concatenation as the target (`{>>{a, b}} = sw[7:0]`), `67` `==` on two
    unpacked arrays, `68` an unpacked array slice, `69` `disable` of a named block. iverilog refuses `60`,
    `62`, `64`, `65`, `67` and `68` too.
  - `70` a `wor` and a `wand` net: the netlist is right, but nextpnr has no place for yosys' `$and` and
    `$or` cells, and the CLI says the design "does not fit the XC7A35T ... Make it smaller", the same
    false diagnosis as `52`.
  - `71` a whole unpacked array assigned in `always_ff`, `72` a void function with output arguments, `73`
    an unpacked array as a function argument: yosys builds them right, iverilog 13 refuses them, so
    `dewfpga sim` fails.
  - `74` a `.v` file that uses `bit` and `final` as names. UG901 p.269: Vivado compiles `*.v` as Verilog
    2005 and `*.sv` as SystemVerilog. The CLI reads every file as SystemVerilog, so both sim and bit stop.
    0 of the 13 corpus `.v` files use such a name.
  - `75` a design that misses 100 MHz (a 14-bit value turned into four registered decimal digits: 33.61
    MHz). A Vivado 2015.2 lab log in the corpus routes at WNS -20.758 ns, prints a critical warning
    ("The design failed to meet the timing requirements") and writes the bitstream. The CLI stops with
    "timing not met ... no bitstream written", which is the recorded decision in `CLAUDE.md` ("timing
    FAIL = hata"). The probe records the difference; which rule wins is the owner's call.
  - `76` implicit nets the standard allows, from a port connection and from the left of an `assign`.
    They build today, with warnings, and a Vivado 2021.2 log of a public CS-224 repo builds one. #3 plans
    `-noautowire` for `39`; with it, `22`, `22b`, `22c`, `22d`, `22f`, `23c`, `39`, `58` and `76` stop
    at synthesis (round 6: a sweep of all 123 probes, each read with and without it; this list named 6
    of them until then). For `22c`, `22d`, `22f`, `39` and `58` that is the change wanted, a silent
    wrong becomes an error; `23c` and `22b` need #4's file fix anyway; `76` (legal implicit nets) and
    `22` (plain modports, which build right today) are there to keep legal code building.
  - `78` UG901's own `(* keep_hierarchy = "yes" *)` (p.60): the CLI's netlist detector matches that text
    and tells the student to delete their design. `79` the same attribute without spaces builds.
  - Unverified in Vivado, patterns from the corpus: `66` `alias` (UG901 p.286 lists both "Aliases:
    Supported" and "Net aliasing: Not Supported"), `77` `initial num = sw;` (a Lab 5 file; yosys stops
    with no file:line), `80` a statement after the reset's if/else in an `always_ff` with an asynchronous
    reset (a Lab 5 folder).
- **The Makefile's async-reset rule is live.** The plan calls it dead code on yosys 0.69 and #5 is set to
  delete it. `80` triggers it on yosys 0.69+post ("Async reset \btnC yields non-constant value", then the
  rule's advice), and so does one corpus lab folder. Its advice does not fit that case (the reset branch
  assigns only `q`); that text is #5's.
- **The equivalence bench let an undriven output through.** It counted an `x` in the netlist apart, to
  excuse flip-flops without a start value, and yosys writes an undriven output as `OBUF` with `.I(1'hx)`.
  The breaker's netlist with `led[4]` undriven printed `EQV PASS: ... (65536 more were x in the netlist
  only)`. Now:
  - `eqv.py --netlist` starts the netlist as the board does: an INIT that is x gets what nextpnr-xilinx
    writes (its `xilinx/fasm.cc`: FDRE, FDCE, LDCE and LDPE start at 0, FDSE and FDPE at 1, and an x bit
    of any other INIT is 0; this said LDPE at 1 until round 4, which the code does not say);
  - an `x` or a `z` in the netlist where the RTL knows the value is a mismatch;
  - the RTL starts a register without a start value at `x`, and a `case` on an `x` takes its default
    branch: `32`'s digit select gave `an = 0111` in the RTL and `1110` on the board until the reset. A
    third copy of the netlist, with its INITs left x, told these apart: a difference where that copy is
    `x` was counted on its own. Only `32` had any (2 bits). Round 4 found that this excused every
    difference of a netlist that never resets, and replaced it.
  - The breaker's netlist now gives `EQV MISMATCH ... led[4] rtl 0, netlist x`.
- **A submodule yosys kept broke the bench.** The netlist's `module inv` (kept for `keep_hierarchy`)
  clashed with the RTL's `inv`. `eqv.py --netlist` renames every design module of the netlist and the
  cells that instantiate them. `79` pins it: `BAD ... 'inv' has already been declared in this scope` on
  the round-2 tree, `ok` now.
- **`eqv_check.sh` did not pin what the notes promise.** Removing the exhaustive walk, the mostly-zeros
  values or the button presses, or counting a `z` as unknown, left all six cases green. It now has 15
  cases (new: `walk` a fault only at `sw=1234`, `sparse` only at `sw=0100`, `button` only while `btnC` is
  pressed, `zout`, `xout`, `init`, `xstart`, `hier`, `hierfault`), and every netlist goes through `eqv.py
  --netlist` as the product's does. 16 mutations of `eqv.py` each turn at least one case red (list
  below).
- **In CI's mode the netlist stage could be emptied.** With a yosys other than the measured one, a stage
  that starts passing is only a note, so deleting the netlist-vs-RTL comparison left the suite green (`03`
  became a note). Two runner checks now run in that mode, each on a design whose netlist differs from its
  RTL (`` `ifdef SYNTHESIS ``, which yosys defines and iverilog does not): `07` with a testbench that sees
  nothing, so only the comparison can catch it, and `54`, whose RTL iverilog cannot compile, so only the
  testbench's `FAIL` on the netlist can. Deleting the comparison turns the first red; dropping the check
  for the testbench's `PASS` turns the second red.
- **CI's step summary got 8 score lines.** The runner checks' broken copies wrote theirs too. They now run
  without `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` and `SV_OUT`, and a check fails if one of them writes a summary (`FAIL` on
  the round-2 tree, `PASS` now). The final run writes one line.
- **`08`'s port-line note could name the wrong line** with every test green: its today column was `-`. It
  now quotes `design.sv:2`, so the note moved to line 3 fails `08` (`expect.tsv says design.sv:2, no
  stage printed it`).
- **`55`'s testbench missed 23 of the 36 LUT flips that change what its netlist does** (every one of its
  48 LUT bits flipped; "changes" = the netlist stage's bench sees a difference against the unflipped
  netlist). It now goes through every reachable state with every value of `sw[2:0]` and `btnC`: 36 of 36.
  It also catches one flip that does not change the board, only keeps the simulation's `x` start state
  from clearing.
- **The Vivado column, read again.** `42` is not supported: `{<<{...}}` is "Re-ordering of the generic
  stream: Not Supported" (p.287); the "Concatenation of stream_expressions: Supported" row above it is
  the stream without re-ordering. `46` `continue` is unverified: "Jump statements: Not Recommended" is all
  the guide says. `48` `iff` is unverified: the same page lists "Iff event qualifier: Supported" and
  "Conditional event controls: Not Supported", and Conditional event controls (IEEE 1800-2017 9.4.2.3) is
  where the standard defines `iff`: slang's table of LRM clauses names 9.4.2.3 so, and its test for it is
  the standard's `always @(a iff enable == 1)`. `45` stays supported and now cites p.280 ("use it with the
  break statement"). The column check now lets a source that shows the guide contradicting itself be
  unverified even when it quotes a Not Supported row (`48`, `66`); 9 column edits of the changed and new
  rows were tried, all 9 refused.
- **`57`'s log quote came from the wrong run.** Its synthesis log holds two runs, and the quote was from
  the first, where the keypad module was still RTL. It now quotes the second (the LUT primitives pulled in
  from `unisim_comp.v`, `(11#1)`, 0 warnings). Which run the implementation used, the logs do not say.
- **`CLAUDE.md`'s corpus line added up to 78 of 73.** It now gives the measurement saved on 24 September
  (`corpus_results.json`, 89 folders): 8 build, 40 are testbench-only, 23 need their own pin file, 7
  hold netlist files, 10 hold code Vivado accepts or that is unverified, 1 is invalid code. (Round 7: of
  the 8, `dewfpga bit` alone built 2; 6 built only with a top the corpus harness named after the CLI
  refused to pick one, and 2 of the 8 are not the module the student's Vivado project built.) (Round 3
  wrote 24 and 9, and called one folder "two clock edges"; round 4 counted again, below.)

Tried, and dropped:
- Counting an `x` in the netlist as a mismatch, with only the board's start values: `32` failed on the
  RTL's `case` over an unset register. Hence the third copy.
- In `eqv_check.sh`, reading `cells_sim.v` with `read_verilog -lib`: yosys keeps its flip-flops as
  whiteboxes, which JSON cannot hold (`-nowb` drops them). Then a register's start value was lost in
  `write_verilog` (it stays an attribute of a merged wire) until `opt_clean -purge`.
- A probe for a concurrent assertion in the testbench (`assert property`): iverilog 13 refuses it, and the
  runner runs the same testbench on the netlist, so the probe would read as a silent wrong.
- A probe for a testbench without `$finish`: the runner needs it to end.

Found and left to later updates (reproduced, not fixed here):
- #3: the silent wrongs `58` and `59`; `-noautowire` has to keep `76` building.
- #4: `60` to `65`, `67` to `69`, and `71` to `73` in sim; `74`, reading `.v` files as Verilog 2005 (the
  CLI check ".v file with SystemVerilog inside builds" says the opposite of Vivado's default); `78`, with
  `57`'s netlist detector; `70`'s cells; `75`, where Vivado writes the bitstream and the recorded decision
  says timing FAIL is an error (the owner decides); a concurrent assertion in a testbench (`dewfpga sim`
  stops with "Try -gno-assertions or -gsupported-assertions", flags the CLI cannot pass).
- #5: `70`'s "does not fit" for two gates; `77`'s "Failed to get a constant init value for \num: \sw" with
  no file:line and no fix; a module whose file is missing from the folder ("Module `\adder4' referenced
  in module `\top' ... is not part of the design", no file:line; `dewfpga sim` does print `top.sv:2`);
  the async-reset rule's advice for `80`; the plan's "dead rule" line.
- #6: a Vivado-style testbench (a free-running clock, no `$finish`) waits 120 s and fails, and its advice,
  "SIM_TIMEOUT=600 dewfpga sim waits longer", cannot help it (measured: 120.48 s, exit 2). Vivado's
  simulator stops at its run time: the run scripts Vivado writes for each simulation (`.tcl`) in the
  corpus say `run 1000ns` 31 times and `run 20000ns` once; the `.log` files hold `run 1000ns` 17 times in
  10 files and `run 20000ns` 4 times in one (round 5: this said "the simulation logs" for the script
  counts). 10 portless module definitions in the corpus have a free-running clock and no `$finish` or
  `$stop` (round 5: this said 9; counted as a module with no ports or an empty port list, `always #` or
  `forever` in it, and no `$finish` or `$stop`; how the 9 was counted is not recorded).

**Break round 4.** The same three kinds of breaker ran against the tree after round 3 and sent 23
reports; two of them are the same break (a netlist that lost its reset), so 22 breaks. Each was run in a
scratch folder: all 22 reproduced. (This said "sent 22 reports" until the final count.) A first attempt
at this round stopped halfway (a network outage); its `eqv.py` rewrite and eight probe drafts were checked
here, one draft was rewritten (`81`) and the rest were finished. Fixed here:
- **Vivado supports 8 more things that no probe had.** Each is a probe now, with its UG901 row. Every
  new testbench passes on a correct design (iverilog on the RTL; for `13c`, `18c`, `21b`, `22e` and `64b`,
  which iverilog refuses, a yosys-slang netlist) and fails on the design with its construct broken (9
  edits, 9 caught).
  - Three new silent wrongs. `22c` an interface with ports (Table 27 p.288, 'Ports in interfaces:
    Supported'): yosys makes `c.q` an implicit wire, and the bitstream builds with 0 LUT and 0 FF, exit
    0, while `dewfpga sim` shows the counter. `22d` an array of interfaces ('Array of interface:
    Supported'): `p[0].d` and `p[1].d` become 1-bit implicit wires, so `led[1]` shows `sw[0]` and `led[0]`
    `sw[4]`. `81` a design module that calls `$finish` in a simulation check (Table 21 p.239, '$finish:
    Ignored'): the CLI's scanner takes a module that calls `$finish` for a testbench, so `dewfpga bit`
    builds its submodule `counter` as the whole design (`counter.bit`, exit 0, no warning) and `dewfpga
    sim` exits 0 printing nothing. The breakers' third form, a modport-typed port on an interface with a
    `clk` port, is the same class as `22c` (0 LUT, 0 FF, exit 0; `sim` stops at the port) and is not a
    probe of its own.
  - Refused: `13c` an unpacked array concatenation, `22e` a modport expression, `64b` an unpacked union
    (sim and bit); `18c` `unique0 if` and `21b` an assignment inside an expression (sim only: yosys
    builds them right).
  - `81` needed a runner change. The runner read only `top.json` and `top.bit`, so `81` read as "synth
    fail, bit fail", a refusal, while the student gets exit 0 and `counter.bit`. The runner now checks
    whatever netlist the CLI wrote and the row's note names the module; a runner that reads only
    `top.json` turns `81` BAD.
  - `81`'s first draft held both modules in `design.sv`. The CLI then hands yosys that file, `$finish`
    included, and yosys stops ("System task `$finish' outside initial block is unsupported."), an error
    rather than the silent wrong the breaker found. The submodule is in its own file now, as in the
    breaker's repro.
- **The equivalence bench passed a netlist that lost its reset.** Round 3 excused a difference while the
  netlist's copy with INITs left x was x; a netlist that never resets keeps that copy x forever. On the
  product's own netlists with every flip-flop reset or set pin that is not a constant tied to 0, round
  3's `eqv.py` printed EQV PASS for all six probes that have such pins (`09`, `10`, `21`, `31`, `32`,
  `34`; 31956, 20140, 96886, 96814, 46705 and 24440 bits excused). The excuse is gone. The RTL's
  registers that are x get the board's start value (from the RTL read by yosys up to `proc`: 1 where a
  reset sets the bit to 1, which yosys maps to FDSE or FDPE, else 0), and with a clock and buttons the
  bench holds every button for one clock edge before the first compare, so a state machine yosys
  re-encoded one-hot, which starts in no state on the board, is compared after its reset. All six: EQV
  MISMATCH now. The same change catches a start value the netlist lost (`lostinit`).
  - Setting a start value bit by bit broke `07`: `statetype [1:0] state` is a packed array of enums, and
    iverilog reads `state[2]` as an enum, not a bit ("Index state[2] is out of range", so EQV FAIL). A
    register is now read whole, its x bits set and written back through a concatenation; a variable of
    one enum type keeps bit selects (it takes no vector without a cast), and a 1-bit enum gets its item
    by name.
- **`eqv.py` started an LDPE at 1, and the notes said nextpnr does.** nextpnr-xilinx's `fasm.cc` (commit
  3fd7878): `int def_init = (type == "FDSE" || type == "FDSE_1" || type == "FDPE" || type == "FDPE_1") ?
  1 : 0;`. The product's FASM for a latch with a preset holds `AFF.ZINI`: it starts at 0. `eqv.py` gives an
  LDPE 0 now; round 3's gave 1. No probe has an LDPE, so no verdict changed.
- **Ports named `x` or `mode` broke the bench** (`'x' has already been declared in this scope`): the
  bench declared a reg per input under the port's own name next to its own `x`, `mode`, `seed`. Every
  name it declares has a prefix now.
- **Parts of `eqv.py` no test pinned**, each pinned now by an `eqv_check.sh` case: the buttons in the
  exhaustive walk (`cbutton`), the `inout` pins driven from outside and compared (`ioequal`, `ioread`,
  `iofloat`), all 4096 random cycles (`deep` now needs 4000; 512 and 3999 turn it red), the reset press
  before the first compare (`recode` shows its IDLE state, so a netlist in no state differs at once), the
  start values (`fdse`, `ldpe`, `ldfill`, `fillset`, `fillaset`, `pkenum`, `enum1`), and the lost reset
  and start value (`lostreset`, `lostinit`). `eqv_check.sh` has 30 cases; `test/run.sh` runs all 30.
  (Round 5: those cases pin the RTL start values of flip-flops with a synchronous reset only. Not
  starting async-reset flip-flops or latches, or reading a reset value's bits in the other order, left
  all 30 green; round 5 added the cases.)
- **The score line was unchecked.** `test/run.sh` compared only the runner's known-gap count. It now
  counts the whole line again from the rows and `expect.tsv` (synthesis, all four stages, supported and
  all four, known gaps). A runner that counts every supported probe as passing (the breaker's 77/77) or
  counts synthesis from the bit stage: green on round 3's tree, FAIL now.
- **The today column's quotes were unchecked.** Only its `file:line` was. The runner now also looks for
  every message the column quotes, word for word (a quote may leave text out with `...`). `01` quotes
  the latch error and its advice, `02` the fix. The breaker's mutation, the latch advice replaced with
  "something went wrong.", was a gap on round 3's runner and is BAD now. Rows that quoted what no stage
  prints were reworded: `08b` and `47` (code, not messages), `75` (the recorded decision, not a log),
  `81`; `22e`, `38` and `71` quote messages that hold apostrophes in double quotes. The check fails with
  any yosys, as the `file:line` check does. Under CI's yosys 0.68 (the YoWASP shim of round 3, brew
  untouched) all 100 probes matched except `75`, whose quote held the frequency nextpnr reached (33.61
  MHz from 0.69+post's netlist, 33.91 MHz from 0.68's); the number is outside the quote now.
- **Checks no test pinned**: the `.v` in the runner's `file:line` pattern (a new check makes the CLI skip
  `.v` files, and `74` has to say `expect.tsv says design.v:3, no stage printed it`), and the
  student-name check's `` `\name' `` form (its self-test now plants that form too).
- **Rows.** `22`'s source cited 'Modport expressions', the `.name(expression)` form that is `22e` now;
  `22` uses plain modports, which UG901 shows in its 'Modports' section (p.283-284). `58` said
  `led[1:0]` undriven: `led[1]` is a constant 0, `led[0]` has no driver, and what the LED shows was not
  measured. `63` was supported with "the probe applies no operator to a real", but UG901 names the cast
  'Cast operator' and lists 'Operators with real operands: Not Supported' next to 'Real ... data types:
  Supported' and "They can only be used as parameter values": the guide contradicts itself, so `63` is
  unverified. The column check did not see `63`'s paraphrase; it guards the two directions that hide a
  gap, and a supported row that names a Not Supported row errs toward counting one (`16b` and `18` name
  one to say why they are supported).
- **Sentences on the site and in the guide that #2 shows false.** Guide section 7 said one course file
  breaks and it is fixed for you: `57` (the course's netlist-form ready modules) is refused and `08b` (the
  port line with a comment in it) is not fixed. It also said the async-load reset and the dual-edge case
  both stop "with the line and the fix" (`03` builds with warnings, `04` has no line), quoted "take the
  original .sv" (the CLI says to delete the file), listed `interface` with `modport` as something Icarus
  accepts (only while no module port is typed with it: `22`, measured), and said a BOM went through (the
  CLI refuses it, with the command that removes it). Section 8 opened with "This covers the part of
  Vivado that CS223 uses, and no more" and named only the IP Catalog; it now names the language, with the
  25 September numbers and a link to `expect.tsv`. The error page `port-neither-input-nor-output` called
  the seven-segment module "the one course file that breaks" and said the language does not read `dp` as
  an output (the guide and `08`'s source say it does). The why page called the IP Catalog "the real
  limit"; it and the home page (English and Turkish) now name the language gap too. The README, its
  Turkish copy and the cli page said every `.sv`/`.v` is synthesized and a module with `$finish` is the
  testbench, "as in Vivado": they now say that a package or an interface alone in its file is left out,
  and that a design module calling `$finish` is taken for a testbench for now (`22b`, `23c`, `81`). The
  guide's HTML and PDF were rebuilt (13 pages; `CLAUDE.md` said 12). The desktop design is untouched:
  text only.
- **The notes and `CLAUDE.md` were wrong**, corrected above: nextpnr starts an LDPE at 0; 25 of the 37
  netlist-passing probes have LUTs, not 22; `58` is missing from the `-noautowire` list and its LEDs were
  never measured "dark"; round 2's "the only probe whose synthesis passes and bitstream fails" and "18
  more things we fail" were overturned in round 3; the corpus has 23 pin-file folders and 5
  unnamed-instance folders (10 in that group), and its "two clock edges" folder fails on `if(reset ||
  clear)` in an `always_ff @(posedge clk, posedge reset)`, probe `53`'s pattern.

Tried, and dropped:
- Setting a register's start value with `force` and `release`: iverilog wants the same cast there ("This
  assignment requires an explicit cast.") for an enum. Walking a 1-bit enum to its item with `.first()`
  and `.next()` through a hierarchical name: vvp stops at an assertion in `v2009_enum.c`.
- Refusing any "not supported" in a supported row's source: `16b` and `18` say it to explain their
  column.

Found and left to later updates (reproduced, not fixed here):
- #3: the silent wrongs `22c`, `22d` and `81` become errors (`81`: a design module is taken for a
  testbench because it calls `$finish`).
- #4: `22c` and `22d` compile (interface ports, interface arrays), `22e`, `13c`, `64b`, and in sim `18c`
  and `21b`; `81` builds as Vivado builds it, which needs the scanner and yosys (it stops at `$finish` in
  an always block) to ignore `$finish`; the course's netlist-form modules (`57`) and the port-line fix
  with comments (`08b`), both now in the guide as open.

**Break round 5.** The same three kinds of breaker ran against the tree after round 4 and sent 22
reports. Each was run in a scratch folder: all 22 reproduced. Two side claims inside them did not: that a
course project hits the same `eqv.py` bug through a wire named `message` (`grep -rlE 'message'` over the
corpus `.sv` and `.v` files, also without case: 0 files; the Lab 4 shape the fix covers was found in one
repo's logs and is the case `regport`), and that the Vivado 2021.2 lab writes its range-only port in an
`always_ff` (it is an `always_comb`, as `08c`'s source says). A first attempt at this round stopped
before it changed anything (a network outage). The eight probe folders a round-4 attempt had left
without rows (`13c`, `18c`, `21b`, `22c`, `22d`, `22e`, `64b`, `81`) already had their rows when this
round started: 100 folders, 100 rows, and the runner's folder check agreed. Fixed here:
- **The netlist stage's RTL side had a copy that no test ran.** `eqv_check.sh` listed the RTL's
  registers with its own copy of the runner's yosys command, so deleting `flatten` from the runner left
  every test green while its comparison passed a netlist whose clock divider, in a submodule, counts
  the wrong way (`EQV PASS: 147456 output bits compared, all equal`: the submodule's register was never
  started, so its LEDs stayed `x` in the RTL and were never compared). The comparison is one script now,
  `test/sv/eqv.sh`: the runner calls it on the product's netlist, and `eqv_check.sh` calls the same
  script on its netlists, which now arrive as the product's do (JSON, the cell library as blackboxes).
  New cases `subreg` and `subfault`: a counter with no reset and no start value in its own module; the
  netlist counts down in `subfault`, which has to fail. Deleting `flatten` from `eqv.sh` turns `subfault`
  red, and deleting `proc` turns 25 cases red. `eqv.sh` also prints `EQV FAIL` when the bench does not
  compile or compares nothing, so a FAIL case now needs the bench's own count of differing bits; neither
  of those passes one.
- **`eqv.py` started a submodule's input port instead of the register behind it.** A register `n` of
  `top` that feeds a submodule's port `D`, next to a register of `top` also named `D` (the shape of a
  CS223 Lab 4 two-bit counter in the corpus): after `flatten` the bit is called `n` and `A1.D`,
  both names end in a name the always block writes, and `A1.D` sorted first. The bench then set a net
  and did not compile (`'eqv_rtl.A1.D' is not a valid l-value for a procedural assignment.`), so a
  correct netlist read as `netlist fail`. `rtl_starts` now looks first at the names declared in the
  module the always block is in (each instance's module lines come from yosys' `$scopeinfo` cells). The
  same fix covers a top wire named like the submodule's register it carries (`subreg`'s `q`). New case
  `regport`, the breaker's design: red before, `EQV PASS: 196608 output bits compared, all equal` after.
- **Parts of `eqv.py` no case pinned.** Each of these left all 30 cases green and now turns one red:
  the compare after the buttons change, before the clock edge (`mealyb`: `led[0] = q & btnC`, lost in
  the netlist; `EQV FAIL: 198 of 262144`); starting async-reset flip-flops (`xstarta`, an FDCE), latches
  (`xstartl`, an LDCE) and each bit of a reset value in its own order (`fillasym`, a reset to `4'b0011`:
  FDSE for bits 0 and 1, FDRE for 2 and 3). Round 4's notes said the start values were pinned; only a
  synchronous reset's were.
- **Runner guards no check pinned.** The check of `"..."` quotes in the today column (`02` quotes the
  unnamed-instance fix that way): deleting it left the suite green, and with the fix text gone from the
  CLI, `02` still matched. The value check of the vivado column: deleting it let a row written
  `Supported` through, and `01` stopped counting as a gap. Both are pinned now (`st_fixtext`,
  `st_vivvalue`), and the CLI check `unnamed instance -> line and fix` now looks for the fix too.
- **Vivado accepts 15 more things that no probe had.** The breakers found 14; `51c` turned up while one
  of their notes was measured. Each is a probe now, with its source: 13 fail a stage, `51c` is a new
  silent wrong among them, and `84` passes all four. Every new testbench passes on a correct design
  (iverilog on the RTL; where iverilog refuses it, a yosys-slang netlist, and for `08c` the line `bit`
  rewrites) and fails on the design with its construct broken (18 edits, 18 caught).
  - `08c` the course's port-line shape where a port has only a range (`output logic [6:0] seg, [3:0]
    an`), written in an `always` block. A Vivado 2021.2 lab in the corpus builds it (0 errors, bitstream
    written; its port list is `output logic [2:0] <one>, [2:0] <other>` and the second is written in an
    `always_comb`, not the `always_ff` the breaker named). `dewfpga sim` stops (`'an' is not a valid
    l-value`), `dewfpga bit` writes the direction in and builds, and after that `sim` passes: the same
    folder passes or fails `sim` by which command ran first. A strict reader calls that port a net (IEEE
    1800-2017 23.2.2.3, slang: "cannot assign to a net within a procedural context"); Vivado and the
    product's port-line fix are the lenient ones.
  - `13d` a packed 2-D array indexed by a variable, then a bit or part select (`grid[i][j] <=` in a loop,
    `grid[sw[13:12]][3:1]`): iverilog refuses both, yosys builds it right. A Vivado 2019.1 course project
    in the corpus reads and writes a `logic [7:0][7:0]` array with two loop indices, `[i][j]`, and builds.
  - `12c` a packed array of structs indexed by a signal, then a member select (`cars[sw[15]].x`): yosys
    stops with "Index in generate block prefix syntax is not constant!", about a generate block the code
    does not have.
  - `33c` the textbook's tristate buffer module (`assign y = en ? a : 4'bz`) in a submodule, four
    instances each driving a nibble of an output port: nextpnr has no place for yosys' `$_TBUF_` cells
    and the CLI says the design does not fit. One instance driving the whole port, or the same buffers in
    `top`, builds (measured). The testbench wants `z` on a disabled nibble, so a fix that turns these
    buffers into logic (as `52`'s internal bus should be) would fail it.
  - `51b` a packed 2-D `localparam` as a seven-segment table: both tools refuse it.
  - `51c` the same table with its type named first, `typedef logic [3:0][6:0] tab_t; localparam tab_t SEG
    = ...`. The breakers reported that this form builds; it does, as zeros: `pnr ok: 0 LUT, 0 FF`, `seg` is
    0 for every input in the netlist (every segment on), exit 0 and no warning. yosys-slang's netlist of
    the same file gives the right table. iverilog 13 stops at an assertion. A new silent wrong.
  - `40b` a module name and `(` inside a `$display` string in a design module (`"counter (u_cnt)
    wrapped"`): the scanner reads comments out but not strings, so it reports an unnamed instance on the
    `$display` line and suggests an edit inside the string. `40` covered only `$display(` itself.
  - `82` `$fopen`, `$fdisplay` and `$fwrite` left in a design (UG901 Table 21: Ignored) and `83`
    `$realtobits` and `$bitstoreal` (Supported): yosys cannot resolve them. iverilog refuses `83` too
    (it cannot evaluate `$realtobits` in a parameter).
  - From UG901 Table 27, rows the breakers checked by hand: `85` a bitstream cast to an unpacked array,
    `23e` a package that exports a name it imported, `86` `extern module`, `87` a `config` (Table 20
    too), `88` a class's static function. All five stop at synthesis; iverilog simulates `23e` and `87`
    (it skips the `config` with a "sorry").
  - `84` a `repeat` with a constant count in `always_comb` (UG901 Table 20: Supported): it passes all four
    stages. It is a probe for iverilog's warning, which `dewfpga sim` prints: "A repeat statement cannot
    be synthesized in an always_comb process." The row quotes it, so when #5 filters the warning the row
    has to change.
- **Sentences #2 wrote or left false.**
  - The home, why and Turkish pages said each construct is measured, and the guide said `test/sv` holds
    one probe per construct a student may write. This round found 15 more; they now say "the constructs
    measured so far", and section 8 says the list is not every construct. Its numbers are the 26
    September ones: 73 of the 99 Vivado-supported constructs fail a stage (52 stop before a bitstream,
    12 fail only in `sim`, 1 has no model, 8 build a wrong bitstream).
  - Guide section 2 said every other Vivado-accepted case "stops with the line and the fix. Section 7
    lists them." `04`, `53`, `77` and `85` stop with no `file:line`, `56` with a line in yosys' own
    `cells_sim.v`, `16c` with no fix, `52`, `70` and `33c` with "does not fit", `12c` with a message about
    a generate block, and the silent wrongs build. It now says so. Section 7
    now lists the two corpus patterns it left out (`53`'s async reset ORed with a clear, one folder, and
    `80`'s statement after the reset's `if`/`else`, one folder), and says that only `bit` writes a
    port's direction in (`08c`). Its "5 of 89 lab folders from old student repos" now says that 4 of the
    5 are one repo's copy of the course's handout folder. Section 2 also said every `.sv` is synthesized
    and named only `$finish`: it now says what the README says.
  - The README, its Turkish copy and the cli page told the student to keep `$finish` in the testbench;
    a design module that calls `$stop` is taken for a testbench the same way (the scanner matches
    `$finish|$stop`, measured with `81`'s files). They now name both.
  - These notes: a failing unverified probe was called a `PASS`, but `03`, `03b`, `05` and `39` build a
    bitstream from a failing netlist and are gaps (the notes and `test/run.sh`'s header, both fixed);
    round 3's `run 1000ns` counts were from Vivado's `.tcl` run scripts, not its logs; the portless
    free-running modules are 10, not 9; round 4's start values were pinned for synchronous resets only;
    round 2's five netlist-form folders are four copies of one handout folder and one student project.
    `CLAUDE.md`'s corpus line says the same now.
  - The guide's HTML and PDF were rebuilt (13 pages). The desktop design is untouched: text only.

Tried, and dropped:
- `23e` as `import p1::*; export p1::*;`: yosys-slang says `K` is undeclared, and it is right. IEEE
  1800-2017 26.6 exports only names actually imported, and a wildcard import makes `K` a candidate until
  the exporting package uses it. The probe imports and exports `p1::K` by name; iverilog then simulates it
  (with the wildcard it could not bind `K` either).
- `regport`'s first netlist was written as RTL (`always_ff`): its flip-flops then start `x` in the
  netlist, and the bench, rightly, called that a difference. The case builds its netlist from FDRE
  primitives, as the product's is.
- A first sweep of the `eqv.py` mutations printed "red: none" for every one: zsh does not split an
  unquoted list, so each run checked only the `equal` case. The sweep now splits the list in bash; the
  results below are from that run.
- A probe for the XDC forms `[get_ports {sw[*]}]` and `[get_ports {sw[0] sw[1]}]` (break 9): every probe
  uses the course's master XDC, so the form cannot be a probe without a second runner path. It is left
  with its fix (below). A `$stop` twin of `81`: the scanner matches both with one pattern, so the text
  fix above is what was false; no probe.

Found and left to later updates (reproduced, not fixed here):
- #3: the silent wrong `51c`.
- #4: `08c` and `13d` in sim; `12c`, `23e`, `33c`, `40b` (the scanner has to skip strings, not only
  `$display(`), `51b`, `82`, `83`, `85`, `86`, `87`, `88`; the XDC forms Vivado accepts in `get_ports`, a
  wildcard (`sw[*]`) and a list (`{sw[0] sw[1]}`): the check reads only the first name and stops with
  "PACKAGE_PIN but no IOSTANDARD" for every port, and nextpnr-xilinx refuses both forms too (#6 owns the
  IOSTANDARD test path).
- #5: `12c`'s message about a generate block, `33c`'s "does not fit", `85`'s message with no
  `file:line`, `40b`'s fix that edits a string, and iverilog's `repeat` warning that `84` quotes.

**Break round 6.** The same three kinds of breaker ran against the tree after round 5 and sent 36
reports. Each was run in a scratch folder: all 36 reproduced (a mutation report by its mutation and the
checks that could catch it, not by a full suite run each; one had a moved line: the lenient-verdict
mutation is on `test/run.sh` line 130, not 126). A first attempt at this round stopped before it changed
anything (a network outage). The eight probe folders the task named as lacking rows (`13c`, `18c`,
`21b`, `22c`, `22d`, `22e`, `64b`, `81`) have had their rows since round 4: 115 folders, 115 rows. Fixed
here:
- **The netlist stage failed correct netlists of three shapes.**
  - A wire that names a slice of an output register (`wire [3:0] low; assign low = led[3:0];`; a corpus
    dot-matrix project has the same shape): `rtl_starts` preferred a name that is not a port, picked
    `low`, and the bench did not compile (`'eqv_rtl.low' is not a valid l-value`). It now looks for the
    name the always block writes whenever more than one name is left. That lookup read whole source
    lines, so an `assign` on the always block's line counted as written too; it now cuts the text at the
    columns of yosys' `src` attribute.
  - A 1-bit enum declared in a submodule or at file scope: the bench named the item in top's scope
    ("Unable to bind wire/reg/memory" for `eqv_rtl.OFF`). It now reaches the item through the variable,
    `s.first()` or `s.last()` (a 1-bit enum has at most two items), whichever has the board's value, so
    where the enum is declared does not matter. (Round 4 found that walking to an item with `.next()`
    through a hierarchical name stops vvp; `.first()` and `.last()` alone run.)
  - A register yosys moves into a ROM. The corpus Lab 4 Gray counter (a full `case`, a `clear` and a
    `preset` not named `btn*`) becomes 6 FDREs whose power-up state holds the first state one clock
    longer; the RTL, started at the board's 0, is one step ahead, and the bench counted 9 differing bits
    (`EQV MISMATCH at 9000 (posedg): q[0] rtl 1, netlist 0`). A register without a start value promises
    no start. The bench now runs a second copy of the RTL, started as `dewfpga sim` starts it (`x`, until
    the `case` default), and a compare where the netlist differs from the first copy passes when every
    bit the first copy knows equals the second: the board then shows what the student's own simulation
    shows. The excuse is per compare, never per bit, and an `x` in the second copy excuses nothing. The
    corpus shape now: `EQV PASS: 36864 output bits compared, all equal (at 9 compares to the RTL as
    dewfpga sim starts it, without start values, not as the board does)`.

  New cases `regslice`, `alias`, `enum1sub` and `romstart`: red on round 5's `eqv.py` and `eqv.sh`,
  `EQV PASS` now.
- **Parts of the netlist stage no case pinned.** Each of these left all 37 cases green on round 5's tree
  and now turns at least one red: the start of a multi-bit enum (`enumstart`: a netlist that powers up
  in state `11`, which the RTL never has), of a memory (`memstart`: a LUT RAM that powers up all ones),
  the compare after the switches change and before the clock edge (`datasw`, the switch counterpart of
  round 5's `mealyb`), `eqv.sh`'s fail-closed guard (`nobench`: a bench that does not compile while the
  RTL does is `EQV FAIL`, exit 1, never a skip), the packages-first order (`pkgfile`: a package in a
  file that sorts after the design), the "nothing compared" fail (`nothing`), and the fallback to the
  name the always block writes (`alias`, `regslice`). The new excuse is pinned both ways: without it
  `romstart` is red, per bit instead of per compare `mixstart` is red (a netlist that takes one bit
  from each start), and with an `x` that excuses `subfault`, `enumstart` and `memstart` are red.
  `eqv_check.sh` has 48 cases; `test/run.sh` runs all 48.
- **Runner and suite guards no check pinned**, each pinned now by a check that breaks it on a copy:
  a row's second quote (`st_quote2`: `04`'s dual-edge advice changed in the product) and its second
  `file:line` (`st_line2`: `76`'s second line made wrong in the table; the breakers counted 24 and 17
  rows with more than one on round 5's table); an `eqv.sh` failure other than exit 2 (`st_eqvexit`:
  `07`'s bench made not to compile has to be a netlist fail; the runner's `-eq 2` could become `-ne 0`
  with every test green); the re-derived verdict's exact mode (`st_exact`, with the measured yosys and
  iverilog: a row that says `ok` where `expect.tsv` records a netlist fail; `sv_rows` takes the table as
  an optional argument for it); every word of the student-name check (`st_names` plants a quoted name
  after each of its 10 words; it planted 3 forms).
- **Probes that pinned nothing the CLI could lose.** No probe's design had two files that reach `sim` and
  `bit`, so a Makefile that compiles only the first design file left every test green: `91` is a
  submodule in its own file, the usual lab layout. No probe's `$display` reached synthesis (`40` and `40b`
  stop at the scanner, `81`'s module is taken for a testbench), so dropping `delete t:$print` left every
  test green: `92` is a debug print in a clocked design. `44`'s do-while could not tell do-while from
  while (its condition is true on entry): it now has a second loop whose condition is false on entry,
  and a reader that tests the condition first fails its testbench.
- **Vivado supports four more things we fail, and no probe had them.** Each is a probe now, with its
  source. Every new testbench of this round passes on a correct design (iverilog on the RTL) and fails
  with its construct broken (10 edits, 10 caught; list in the evidence).
  - `89` logic on a divided clock. The course's master XDC arrives with `create_clock` commented out,
    and the CLI then checks every clock at 100 MHz: four decimal digits of a 14-bit value on the slow
    clock reach about 35 MHz, and `bit` stops with "timing not met". 11 routed Vivado timing reports in
    the corpus (2015.2 to 2021.2), each next to the `.bit` its run wrote, list a register clocked from a
    register under "no clock driven by root clock pin" and do not time it; with no `create_clock`, the
    board clock is listed there too. With `create_clock` uncommented, nextpnr checks the divided clock at
    its default 12 MHz and builds the breaker's version. The same rule stops a button used as a clock
    (`posedge btnC`, no `clk` at all; measured, not a probe of its own).
  - `90` `initial if (N < 8) $warning(...)`, UG901's own form of a parameter check (Table 27 p.286; the
    report said p.285): yosys "Can't resolve task name" for `$warning`, and for `$info` the same. The
    form without `initial`, and the `initial` form while its condition is false, build.
  - `22f` an interface without ports whose members top drives and reads (`bus.a`): 0 LUT, exit 0, while
    `dewfpga sim` is right. It shows that `22c` and `22d` fail for the same reason, a member of an
    interface instance used in the module that instantiates it, not for their ports or their array.
    `22c`'s row says so now, so a #3 fix aimed at "ports in interfaces" would not pass it.
  - `56b` a file that holds only file-scope typedefs (UG901 'Compilation Units', p.270): the CLI hands
    the tools only files with a module, and both stop at the first use in `design.sv`, naming neither
    the missing file nor the fix. In which order Vivado compiles such a file is not in the guide. The
    README, its Turkish copy, the cli page and the guide said only a package or an interface alone in
    its file is left out; they now say a file that holds no module.
  - Two whose Vivado status no source settles, recorded as unverified. `63b` a real literal in a
    localparam used in an expression (`localparam MAX = 1e1; ... count == MAX - 1`; a lab writes `50e6`):
    yosys 0.69+post segfaults, and bash prints the crash and the Makefile's whole awk program (1.4 kB)
    with no `file:line`; `parameter real` times a signal, and `int'` of a `localparam real`, crash the
    same way. `37b` `logic [3:0] sum = sw[3:0] + sw[7:4];`: `dewfpga sim` follows IEEE 1800-2017 6.8
    (an initializer, set once, so `x`), `dewfpga bit` builds an adder, and neither says a word. Its
    testbench checks the standard's reading, so it is a silent wrong whatever Vivado does.
- **Rows and sentences #2 shows false.**
  - `33` said "the inout read-back is lost". Reading back a bidirectional pin works (`33`'s `JA[0]`,
    and `33b`); what is lost is a pin the design sets to a constant `z` (`assign JA[7:1] = 7'bz`) and
    then reads. The row, these notes and guide section 8 say so now.
  - `82`: with `$fopen` gone, `$fdisplay` stops yosys next, not `$fwrite`. `59` builds with nextpnr's
    generic "No clocks found in design" warning, not with no warning. `08c`'s comment said `an` takes
    `output logic` from `seg`; its own source says a strict reader makes it a net.
  - The cli page and guide section 5 said the course's seven-segment file "builds as it is". The course
    also hands `SevSeg_4digit.sv` out in netlist form (row `57`; the corpus holds 3 netlist-form copies),
    which the CLI refuses; both now say so, and section 7 names it among the netlist-form modules. The
    error page `port-neither-input-nor-output` said the fix is skipped when "a comment sits inside the
    port list"; the course file has three comments there and builds. It now names the two cases that
    miss (a comment between `seg,` and `logic dp`, a `;` inside a comment), as section 7 does.
  - The why page said each construct sits "next to what Vivado's documentation says"; 10 rows cite only a
    Vivado log or IEEE 1800. It now says "what Vivado does and the source for it". It also called clock
    dividers "the part this chain handles"; it now names `89`'s difference. Guide section 2 said section
    7 lists "what old student repos hit" and section 8 said "what the course's own files hit"; both say
    the course's files and old student repos now.
  - The README, its Turkish copy and guide section 2 said `bit` refuses to write a bitstream when timing
    is not met, and nothing about what is timed. They now say that without `create_clock` every clock
    is checked at 100 MHz, a divided one too (`89`), and that a multiplier in a DSP48E1 with a register
    inside is not timed at all (below).
  - Guide section 8's numbers are this round's: 77 of the 105 Vivado-supported constructs fail a stage
    (55 stop before a bitstream, 12 fail only in `sim`, 1 has no model, 9 build a wrong bitstream). The
    guide's HTML and PDF were rebuilt (13 pages); the desktop design is untouched, text only.
  - These notes: the `-noautowire` list named 6 of the 9 probes it changes (above), and did not say that
    `22`, legal code, stops building with it.

Tried, and dropped:
- Leaving the RTL's registers `x` instead of starting them (round 3's first reading): `32`'s `case` on an
  unset register takes its default branch in the RTL and not on the board. Hence two copies of the RTL.
- Excusing a difference bit by bit, each bit equal to either copy: `mixstart`, a netlist that takes bit 0
  from one start and bits 2:1 from the other, passed. The excuse is per compare.
- Quoting the crash in `63b`'s row: the YoWASP build of yosys 0.68, CI's version, does not
  segfault; it stops at an internal cell check, and the row failed there (`expect.tsv quotes
  'Segmentation fault: 11', no stage printed it`). The row names the crash without quoting it.
- A probe for the DSP timing (break 2): every stage passes, so the runner would count it `ok`, and no
  stage compares timing with a real delay. It is left with its fix.
- A probe for two `assign`s to one `wire` (break 8): its `vivado` column would need a source for what
  Vivado does (the breaker says it refuses a multi-driven net; no log here shows it), and the message is
  #5's.

Found and left to later updates (reproduced, not fixed here):
- #3: the silent wrongs `22f` and `37b`. Paths through a DSP48E1 with a register inside are not timed:
  three multiplies and an add in one clock print `PASS at 100.00 MHz` (282.97 MHz, `DSP48E1: 5/120`, no
  DSP cell in the critical path), while the same logic in LUTs reaches 34.04 MHz; nextpnr-xilinx 3fd7878's
  `getPortTimingClass` returns `TMG_IGNORE` for a registered DSP48E1.
- #4: `56b` and `90`; `89`'s timing rule, with `75`'s (Vivado writes the bitstream; the owner decides);
  `63b`, if Vivado builds it.
- #5: any yosys crash prints the Makefile's whole awk program and no `file:line` (`63b`); two `assign`s to
  one `wire` stop in nextpnr with "Net 'y' is multiply driven by cell ports ..." about internal cells,
  no `file:line` and no fix (for `wire y`, `dewfpga sim` shows `x` and passes; for `logic y`, iverilog
  names the line).
- #6: with two clocks the board clock is printed as `$abc$...$aiger$oN` on the pnr line and in the timing
  error (`32`: `$abc$2758$aiger$o7 399.20 MHz`), next to round 2's garbled name of `03`.
- #12: `dewfpga sim` with two design roots says `Name it:  dewfpga bit decoder` (`check_xdc.py` writes
  `bit` for sim too); `dewfpga sim decoder` works. The plan lists it with top selection in VS Code.

**Break round 7.** The same three kinds of breaker ran against the tree after round 6 and sent 21
reports. Each was run in a scratch folder: 20 reproduced as written and one in part (the port-line
comment, below); a mutation report by its mutation and the cases or checks that could catch it, not by a
full suite run each. Three side claims did not hold (below). A first attempt at this round stopped before
it changed anything (a network outage). The eight probe folders the task named as lacking rows (`13c`,
`18c`, `21b`, `22c`, `22d`, `22e`, `64b`, `81`) have had their rows since round 4, as round 6 found too:
123 folders and 123 rows before this round, 132 and 132 after. Fixed here:
- **The netlist stage passed wrong netlists through round 6's sim-start excuse.** A compare passed when
  every bit the RTL knows equalled a second copy of the RTL started as `dewfpga sim` starts it, decided
  compare by compare. A digit-select counter with no reset and no start value (a lab's display scan)
  showed the hole: `dewfpga sim` keeps `sel` at `x` forever, its `case` takes the default at every
  compare, and a product netlist with one LUT INIT bit flipped (digit 0 never lights) equalled the
  board's start at some compares and that copy at the others: `EQV PASS: 196608 output bits compared, all
  equal (at 3072 compares to the RTL as dewfpga sim starts it, ...)`. A netlist that lost the counter and
  shows 1111, what sim shows, passed the same way. The exception is now one decision for the whole run:
  the netlist has to follow the RTL as the board starts it at every compare, or follow the sim copy at
  every compare, equal to the board's start while a register bit of the sim copy is still `x` (its
  outputs then come from a branch no board takes) and equal to the sim copy, every bit known in it, once
  none is. Both netlists: `EQV FAIL: 3072 of 196608` and `EQV FAIL: 9216 of 196608`. New cases `simflip`
  and `simlost`: `EQV PASS` on round 6's bench, `EQV FAIL` now.
- **A reset on a switch was not pressed before the compares.** The bench held only `btn*` inputs for one
  clock edge first, so a state machine yosys re-encoded one-hot passed with its reset on `btnC` and failed
  with the same reset on `sw[15]` (`EQV FAIL: 10 of 196608`, all before the walk first raised `sw[15]`).
  The bench now also holds every input bit that resets a register of the RTL (the `SRST` and `ARST` of
  the flip-flops yosys makes of the RTL, when they are an input bit), at its active level. The corpus
  Gray counter round 6 made the excuse for (its `clear` and `preset` are switches) now passes without it.
  Five cases pinned a register's start through a switch reset (`xstart`, `fillset`, `fillaset`,
  `xstarta`, `fillasym`); pressed first, that start no longer shows (with the reset value ignored, all
  five stayed green), so their reset is now built from two switches, `sw[15] & sw[14]`, which the bench
  does not press, and the reset-value mutation turns `fillset`, `fillaset` and `fillasym` red again. New
  case `swreset`: `EQV FAIL` on round 6's bench, `EQV PASS` now.
- **The bench did not compile for an output that is part register, part `assign`** (`always_ff ...
  led[3:0] <= ...; assign led[15:4] = sw[15:4];`): the start wrote `led` whole, iverilog refused it
  (`Cannot perform procedural assignment to variable 'eqv_rtl.led' because it is also continuously
  assigned.`), and a correct netlist got `EQV FAIL`. `eqv.sh` now reads the names iverilog gives there,
  and `eqv.py --bits` writes the bench again with those registers started one bit select at a time (a
  bit select of a packed array of more than one dimension picks an element, so such a variable fails
  the bench by name instead). iverilog shows such a register bit as `z` before its first write, not `x`,
  so the start takes `z` for unset too. New case `partassign`: red on round 6's bench, `EQV PASS` now.
- **Parts of the netlist stage no case pinned**, each pinned now: "an `x` in the sim copy excuses
  nothing" (dropping it left all 48 cases green; `xhold`, a RAM never written read at a registered
  address, where the netlist reads `x` and so does the sim copy), and `STARTS_AT_1`'s `FDSE_1` and
  `FDPE_1` (`negset`, falling-edge registers with a synchronous set and an asynchronous preset). No probe
  had a falling-edge register either: `31b` has both, with resets built from two switches, so the start
  shows. `eqv_check.sh` has 54 cases; `test/run.sh` runs all 54.
- **`13d`'s testbench missed faults.** It is the only check of `13d`'s netlist (iverilog cannot compile
  the RTL), and it clocked the grid in and picked the row and column with the same switches, so 16 LUT
  INIT flips that change the netlist passed it. It now clocks the grid in from one value and picks the
  row and column with another (the 256 patterned values, then 19744 random pairs). Over all 432 LUT bits
  of the product's netlist: 414 caught (the breaker counted 308 with the old testbench). The 18 that pass all sit in the LUT that drives
  `led[12]`, and they are exactly the 18 input combinations of that LUT that never occur over every grid
  value and every row and column (1048576 cases), so none of them changes what the netlist does.
- **Runner and suite guards no check pinned**, each pinned now by a check that breaks it: the rtl
  stage's exit-code half (`st_rtlexit`: `07`'s testbench made to call `$error` and still print `PASS`;
  `st_tbfail` pinned only the `PASS` half); a missing score line (`sv_rows` compared the line only when
  there was one; `st_score` now also gives it a log with no score line and one that writes `Synthesis`,
  and each has to fail); the personal-path check, which skipped all of `test/run.sh`. It now scans every
  file: a home folder is `/Users/` and a name, `test/run.sh` writes its planted paths through `printf`'s
  `%s`, and a new check plants one in `test/run.sh` itself.
- **Constructs no probe had.** Each is a probe now, with its source; every new testbench passes on the
  RTL (iverilog) and fails with its construct broken (evidence below).
  - `93` two modules nothing instantiates, in one file named after one of them. When two roots qualify,
    the scanner takes one named like the `.xdc` or like its own file without saying so: `counter.sv`
    holding `counter` and the board version `top` builds `counter`, exit 0, `counter.bit`, and with one
    design file the CLI prints no `top module:` line. Saved as `lab4.sv`, the same file stops and names
    both. Two corpus Lab 4 projects have this shape (Vivado 2015.2; each `.xpr` and `runme.log` names the
    board version as the top): the CLI alone builds the plain counter of one (`061`, `pnr ok: 6 LUT, 6
    FF`), and refuses the other (`058`), where the corpus harness then named the plain one. Guide section
    2 said "names both and you choose"; it, the README, its Turkish copy and the cli page name the
    exception now.
  - `94` a variable raised to a constant power, `sw[7:0] ** 2` (UG901 p.278: "A**B is supported if A is
    a power of 2 or B is a constant."): yosys leaves a `$pow` cell, nextpnr has no place for it, and the
    CLI says the design does not fit. `16'd3 ** sw[2:0]`, which the note does not cover, stops the same
    way; `2 ** sw[3:0]` and `sw[7:0] * sw[7:0]` build.
  - `96` a one-bit vector port (`[N-1:0]`, `N = 1`) and `96b` a port numbered from 1 (`[4:1]`, with the
    lab's own XDC; the runner now takes a probe's own `Basys3_Master.xdc`): the CLI's XDC check names a
    one-bit vector port without its index and numbers every port's bits from 0, so it stops before place
    and route with "these ports have NO pin" and a fix that does not apply. nextpnr-xilinx places both
    right when run on the product's `top.json` (`led` and `sw` on `led[0]`'s and `sw[0]`'s sites; `sw[1]`
    to `sw[4]` on theirs).
  - `97` UG901's `(* ram_style = "block" *)`: yosys builds a RAMB18E1 despite `-nobram`, nextpnr does not
    time it (`pnr ok: 0 LUT, 0 FF, no clocked paths, timing not applicable`), and yosys' `cells_sim.v`
    has no model for it, so the netlist reads `z`. It counts with `35` as a bitstream the suite cannot
    check. `(* rom_style = "block" *)` on an initialized ROM gives a RAMB18E1 the same way (measured,
    no probe). README, its Turkish copy and guide section 8 said every memory becomes LUTs; they name the
    exception now.
  - Three whose Vivado status no source settles, recorded as unverified: `95` a submodule with ports and
    no body whose output top uses (yosys makes it a blackbox, and the CLI says the design does not fit);
    `98` a module named `INV` (`GND`, `VCC` and `MUXF7` too; `BUF` builds): yosys stops in its own
    `cells_sim.v`, with no line of the student's file; `99` `parameter string INIT_FILE = ...`: a yosys
    syntax error with no fix, while the untyped form builds and matches the RTL.
- **Rows and sentences #2 shows false.**
  - "14 silent wrongs" (these notes, the plan): `expect.tsv` has 15 rows where the bitstream builds and
    the netlist fails, and the runner counts all 15 alike. The 15th, `35_mmcm`, fails for lack of a
    model, not because it is wrong. The notes now name it; with `93` and `97` there are 17 such rows: 15
    silent wrongs and 2 bitstreams no model can check.
  - "8 build" (`corpus_results.json`, in round 3's `CLAUDE.md` item and round 1's list below):
    `dewfpga bit` alone built 2 of the 89 folders (`004`, `061`); the other 6 built only after the corpus
    harness named a top the CLI had refused to pick, and 2 of the 8 (`058`, `061`) are not the module the
    student's Vivado project built. `CLAUDE.md` and both places here say so now.
  - `22f`'s source said UG901's p.282 example uses an interface's members in the module that instantiates
    it; the example uses them only inside the submodules, through their interface port. The row says so,
    and rests top's own use on Table 27's "Hierarchical names: Supported" (p.288).
  - The why page gave each construct's source as "its user guide, a Vivado log, or the language
    standard"; `04` and `05` cite forum posts, marked weak. It names them now.
  - Guide section 7 said the port-line fix misses "a comment inside the port list (after `seg,` ...)". It
    misses a comment between `seg,` and `logic dp` (at the end of the `seg,` line, on a line of its own,
    or a `/* */` between the two) and a comment anywhere in the port list that holds a `;`; a comment
    after `logic dp,` or before the comma is fine. The same sentence quoted the yosys error in backquotes
    that broke the guide's HTML (the rest of the paragraph rendered as code, up to `bit`). Both are fixed,
    and the guide's HTML and PDF rebuilt. The error page's sentence ("unless a comment sits between
    `seg,` and `logic dp`") holds.
  - Guide section 8's numbers are this round's: 82 of the 111 Vivado-supported constructs fail a stage
    (58 stop before a bitstream, 12 fail only in `sim`, 2 have no model, 10 build a wrong bitstream).

Side claims that did not hold:
- The port-line report's "a comment after `seg,` on the same line is fixed": only because the breaker's
  comment ended in a comma (`// a comment after seg,`), which the fix reads as the port separator; with
  `// the segments` there the line is not fixed (evidence below).
- "Vivado 2020.1 logs in the corpus warn on an undriven net ([Synth 8-3848])": the two corpus logs with it
  are Vivado 2015.2 and 2021.2.
- `94`'s report put UG901's "Power operator" on p.227-228 and read it as supported without condition. The
  Verilog-2001 list that holds it is on p.229, and the conditions are Ch.10's note (p.278) and Table 25
  (p.249): a variable base with a constant power is supported, `3 ** sw` is not. `94` probes the first.

Tried, and dropped:
- Starting a part-assigned register with `force` and `release` on the whole variable: iverilog 13 left the
  register bits at `z` after the release ("procedural continuous assignments are not yet fully
  supported"). Bit selects work.
- Choosing the variables to start bit by bit from their declaration's text (how many packed dimensions it
  has): a comma list, `logic [1:0][3:0] a, b;`, hides them from `b`. iverilog names exactly the variables
  it refuses, so the bench is written again with those.
- Keeping the excuse per compare and requiring only every bit known in the sim copy: the flipped digit
  counter's sim copy has no `x` output at any compare (the `case` default is a constant), so it still
  passed.
- Pressing only `btn*` and letting the switch-reset state machine fail: round 4's reason for the press (a
  student presses reset after loading the board) holds for a switch too.
- Sweeping `13d`'s 432 flips against every grid value and every row and column, one netlist copy per
  flip: 432 copies times 1048576 cases was too slow for this machine; the 18 survivors were instead checked
  by recording which input combinations of their LUT ever occur over the same 1048576 cases (7 s).

Found and left to later updates (reproduced, not fixed here):
- #3: `93`, the tie-break that builds another module than the project's top with no message (the CLI has
  to stop and name both, or say which it took and why); the block RAM of `97` is not timed, next to round
  6's registered DSP48E1.
- #4: `94` (the `$pow` cell), `96` and `96b` (the XDC check's port names); `95`, `98` and `99` if Vivado
  builds them.
- #5: "the design does not fit" for `94` and `95` (a `$pow` cell, an empty module's blackbox: neither is a
  size problem), the same message's "with -nobram every memory becomes LUTs" (false for `97`), `98`'s
  error inside `cells_sim.v` with no line of the student's file and no fix, `99`'s syntax error with no
  fix.
- #6: a falling-edge design's clock named on the pnr line by a cut internal name (`31b`: `pnr ok: 11 LUT,
  5 FF, 337:slice$1535.C': 358.68 MHz`: the awk cuts the name at its first colon), next to round 6's
  garbled names.

**What the breakers tried that held.** Every round, the breakers also reported what they tried and could
not break. Those runs are part of the evidence, so they are listed here, round by round.
- Round 1.
  - The runner's numbers: the full probe run and `test/run.sh` gave the score line and the stage counts
    these notes then printed (rtl 35/8, synth 32/11, netlist 28 pass, 4 fail, 11 not run, bit 32/11;
    Vivado column 36, 2, 5), under macOS's `/bin/bash` 3.2 too. The old runner's numbers (33/43, 35/43,
    29/33) match its saved result file.
  - Mutations the suite caught: every LUT INIT set to 0 (19 probes fail at the netlist stage; the other
    9 have no LUT cells), `--fix-ports` off (`08`), `create_clock` uncommented (the warning quoted above),
    `-g2005`, an expectation flipped, a probe folder without a row, malformed rows, the header renamed, the
    netlist `PASS` check dropped (`05` and `33` BAD with the measured yosys), `--prefer-tb` removed from the
    CLI (`26` BAD), a home-folder path planted in a probe (the hygiene check FAILs). All 8 flip-flop INIT
    flips in `37`'s netlist were caught.
  - Sources: the UG901 v2023.2 and v2022.2 and UG953 v2022.2 pages cited then were opened and hold (one
    breaker downloaded UG953 from xilinx.com; its sha256 equals the copy used here), and so do the corpus
    Vivado log quotes of `01`, `02`, `07`, `08` and `32`. `03`, `03b`, `04` and `05` staying unverified is
    right: no UG901 text on them, and no corpus log with Synth 8-91, 8-6859 or MDRV-1.
  - Designs a student writes that passed all four stages: a BCD converter with `/` and `%` (every value 0
    to 9999), bits of one output from two `always_ff` and an `always_comb`, Verilog-2001 non-ANSI ports with
    `defparam`, a net declaration assignment and `{cout, sum}` on the left, a RAM filled by an `initial`
    loop and then written, a blocking temporary inside `always_ff`, a `localparam` in the parameter port
    list, a compilation-unit `typedef struct` and `enum` as port types, a function with a loop and a local,
    `/` and `%` by a variable. Two `assign`s to one wire stop in nextpnr (not silent; the message is #5's).
  - 28 corpus testbench pairs gave the same waveforms on the RTL and the product's netlist; the 3
    differences were testbench races (stimulus on the clock edge) or `x` at time 0. The sweep stopped at
    folder 39, where one VCD reached 532 MB on this 8 GB machine.
  - The product did not change (`bin/`, `templates/`, `sim/` equal to HEAD), and the 89 corpus lab folders
    give the same results before and after: 8 build (2 by `dewfpga bit` alone, 6 with a top the harness
    named; round 7), the same error lines, only their order changed in two
    folders (the Python set, above).
  - CI's log of the last pushed commit shows yosys 0.68+post and Icarus 13.0; the 43 match under the
    YoWASP build of 0.68. The Homebrew bottle itself was not run here.
  - Privacy: no corpus owner name, no home-folder path; `06` is a reduced rewrite of a lab, not a copy;
    `ci.yml` parses and the npm package is unchanged (`test/` is not in its `files`).
- Round 2.
  - Designs that passed every stage, the equivalence check included: a full-case `always_comb` without a
    default, `unique case` without a default, an unpacked array with a pattern initializer and `assign
    segs = '{...}`, `$countones`, `$onehot`, `$onehot0`, a default port value left unconnected, a packed
    union, `const`, a real `localparam` converted to an integer, a file-scope enum whose names do not clash,
    a file-scope function, a `$readmemb` ROM from a `.txt` file with asynchronous and synchronous reads, a
    CRLF XDC and a CRLF source with the course's `dp` line, the course's exact seven-segment port line with
    its trailing comment. A signal declared and never assigned gets yosys' "used but has no driver"
    warning (Vivado warns too, Synth 8-3848 in 2 corpus logs; the message has no `file:line`).
  - The Harris and Harris testbench style (`$readmemb` vectors, `assert ... else $error`) reports a
    mismatch with its `file:line` and exit 2. 3 real corpus labs that build (a Gray counter, a multi-digit
    display, a traffic-light FSM): `eqv.py` PASS against the product's netlist. 21 corpus xsim elaboration
    logs, each module set run through `dewfpga sim`: only the known classes failed (`38`, `34`, a
    testbench without `$finish`, two roots).
  - Mutations the suite caught: the netlist stage without its `PASS` check (`39`), the unnamed-instance
    line off by one (`02`, `40`), `exact=0`, regressions turned into notes under yosys 0.68 (`st_stale`), the
    row-count check removed with a malformed row, the old personal-path grep, `--fix-ports` off, every LUT
    INIT 0 (19), `-g2005` (37 of 51), the sim built with `-s $(TOP)` (`07`, `09`), a broken `16c`. 60 LUT
    flips over `13`, `15`, `21`, `29`, `32`: 58 caught; the one `29` survivor also passes 65536 cycles.
  - The regression breaker ran HEAD and the tree side by side: 51 passed before; 86 passed with 23 gaps
    after, all 51 old checks among them; the corpus identical but for the error order in three folders.
    They recounted the table, re-ran `30`'s LUT flip (the same two lines), the source mutations (122 killed,
    32 survived) and 372 distinct LUT flips of their own (42 survive, every one explained above), and
    re-read the UG901 and UG953 pages and the corpus quotes: all hold. `test/run.sh`'s install check
    points the Homebrew link at whichever copy runs it (known; restored after every run).
- Round 3.
  - Designs that passed sim, bit and the equivalence check: a declaration in an unnamed `begin` block,
    `#(W = 4)` without the `parameter` keyword, a `localparam` in the header list, `repeat (2)`, C-style
    `logic [3:0] mem [16]`, a packed union, `$countones`, `$onehot`, `$onehot0`, `$countbits`, `$high`,
    `$low`, `$size`, `$left`, a task with output arguments, a file-scope packed struct as a port type, an
    implicit net in a port connection, `byte`, `shortint`, `int unsigned`, default port values, `const`, a
    struct bitstream cast, a positional pattern `'{a, b}`, a constant function in a `localparam`, a
    function that reads a module variable inside `always_comb`, `defparam`, `initial if (W < 1)
    $error(...)`, `unique0 case`, `wire logic` and `var logic`. Blocking and nonblocking assignments mixed on
    one variable in `always_ff`: EQV PASS.
  - `37`'s power-up values reach the bitstream: the FASM's ZINI bits match the 8 flip-flop INITs. A
    combinational design with `create_clock` uncommented only warns and writes its `.bit`. Immediate
    asserts that fail in a testbench exit 2 with the `file:line`.
  - The equivalence check on all 30 probes whose netlist then passed: 25 PASS, and the 5 skipped are the
    ones the notes named. Every output bit of the 25 is compared at least once (a per-bit counter). The
    slowest bench runs 4.5 s against the runner's 30 s limit. Corpus: 38 lab tops EQV PASS; two mismatches
    come from registers the RTL leaves `x`, judged not synthesis faults but not proved cycle by cycle.
  - Mutations the suite caught with the measured yosys: the comparison removed (`03`), the netlist's
    `PASS` check dropped (`39`), no button presses (`03`).
  - The regression breaker: the corpus through HEAD and the tree with a fixed hash seed, 0 differences;
    99 passed with 41 gaps, all 51 old checks among them; 69 of 69 under yosys 0.68 with the same rows;
    every quoted message found in the stage logs; the UG901 and UG953 pages and the corpus quotes of `01`,
    `38`, `53` and `54` hold; round 2's testbenches of `41`, `43`, `47`, `49` and `50` walk every input and
    tell the construct from its misreading. Not re-run by them: rounds 1 and 2's source-mutation counts,
    the 236-flip totals, and which synthesis run `57`'s bitstream came from.
- Round 4.
  - All 92 probes under yosys 0.68 (the YoWASP shim) and natively: 92 of 92 match, the same score line
    (11 min 49 s and 6 min 31 s). Only `32` has start-value differences. The slowest bench takes 6 s.
  - Constructs that passed all four stages: `const`, a packed union, an array pattern assigned to a
    variable, a default port value left unconnected, a bitstream cast `s_t'(v)`, `$countones`, `$onehot`,
    `$onehot0`, `$countbits`, `$size`, `$high`, `$low`, `$left`, `$right`, `$dimensions`,
    `$unpacked_dimensions`, `$increment`, `defparam`, `repeat (3)`, `` `default_nettype none ``, `$error` in
    an `initial` on a parameter, `$fatal` in a generate `if`, `bufif1` to a pin, a constant function in a
    `localparam`, a `localparam` in the parameter header, an enum variable without a typedef, a packed 2-D
    port, `$rtoi($ceil($log10()))` and `$sqrt` in parameters, `16'(2 ** sw[3:0])`, `/` and `%` of two
    variables, `always_ff @(negedge clk)` (FDRE_1 and CLKINV in the FASM), a RAM filled by an `initial`
    loop, `$readmemb("rom.data")`.
  - Corpus: every lab folder through `dewfpga bit` and `eqv.py`: 21 EQV PASS, 2 start-value artifacts (a
    ROM default of `x`, a counter with no start value clocking a register that has one), 1 with no known
    output bit; no synthesis fault.
  - Mutations that changed no verdict then and were not reported: FDSE and FDPE not started at 1 (the old
    excuse hid it; round 4 then removed the excuse), the negedge compare dropped, the "nothing compared"
    guard dropped (pinned in round 6). Caught: 256 cycles (`dense`, `sparse`), the port-line fix taking
    the first direction (`08`), the CLI ignoring `.v` files (`74`). A reset tied off in each flip-flop with
    a driven reset or set pin (55 faults over 21 and 12 clocked probes, 37 of which change the board): the
    testbenches catch all 37; only the equivalence check missed them (the round's high break). No false
    fail on `33b` or on a combinational design with buttons.
  - The regression breaker: 119 passed with 56 gaps; one summary line; the corpus unchanged but for one
    folder's error order; the table, the arithmetic of the notes and the 0.68 rows recounted; `75` reaches
    33.61 MHz; the UG901 pages of `52` to `80` and the v2022.2 cites of `13b`, `42`, `48` and `66` hold;
    slang's table names 9.4.2.3 and its test is `always @(a iff enable == 1)`; the corpus quotes of `53`,
    `54`, `75`, `76` and `77` hold; nextpnr-xilinx writes an `x` bit of a LUT INIT as 0; `git ls-files`
    lists all 193 probe files (none ignored, so CI gets them); no corpus owner name, checked one at a time.
- Round 5.
  - Designs that passed every stage: `$countones`, `$onehot`, `$onehot0`, `2**sw[3:0]`, `/` and `%` by a
    variable, `===` and `!==`, `$size`, `$left`, `$right`, `$high`, `$low`, `$rtoi($sqrt)`, `$ceil` and
    `$pow` in localparams, `defparam`, `repeat (8)`, `assign #5`, `<= #1`, `and #2`; signed `/`, `%`,
    `>>>`, `*`, compare and `**` on all 65536 inputs (equal except divide by zero, where the RTL is `x`);
    `$floor`, `$ln`, `$log10`, `$exp`, `$sin`, `$cos`, `$atan2`, `$hypot`, `$asin`, `$countbits`,
    `$increment`, `$dimensions`, `$unpacked_dimensions`; a default port value, a packed union, `const`, a
    bitstream cast, an enum in a numeric expression, a constant function; two `always_comb` sharing a
    module-level `integer`; an `initial` loop RAM with a later write; an output port with an initializer;
    register-file writes `mem[a][3:0] <=` and `mem[a][b] <=`; an unconnected submodule input (0, as in
    Vivado); an ascending `output logic [0:6] seg` (the routed `seg[0]` lands on W7, as the XDC says); a
    button as a clock, with and without `CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE FALSE`; a gated clock; a testbench that
    ends in `$stop`; the Harris and Harris testbenches; an `inout` tristate in a submodule on `JA`. A
    non-constant `$clog2` stops `bit` with a `file:line`; what Vivado does with it is not verified.
  - Corpus: `dewfpga sim` on 55 testbench targets, 18 pass, the rest the known classes or student bugs;
    36 designs EQV PASS against the product's netlist. The Gray counter one clock behind after power-up
    was noted and not reported then; round 6 fixed the bench for it.
  - Mutations: `eqv.py` with a binary walk, reset values ignored, `$sdff` not started, no button presses
    after the start, the reset press without a clock edge, 1024 cycles, 15 exhaustive bits, pins never
    driven, only the RTL's 1 bits compared, enum starts off, a latch started at its preset, modules not
    renamed, every flip-flop INIT `x` set to 0: each killed by a case. No data compare: `33b` fails.
    Equivalent or dead, not reported: `hdlname` ignored, the all-0 and all-1 modes dropped, one edge's
    compare dropped, 4001 cycles, a button rate of 1/2. Not verified then: FDSE_1 and FDPE_1 entries, the
    memory start, the `assigned_in` bypass (round 6 pinned the last two).
  - LUT flips in the 10 probes whose comparison is skipped: the testbenches catch every flip that changes
    the netlist (`55`'s 11 and `73`'s 3 survivors each match the unflipped netlist). A source-operator
    sweep over the 62 probes whose rtl passes left only equivalent mutants and known cases.
  - The regression breaker: 138 passed with 63 gaps (791 s at a load of 17 to 27); the rows equal the
    table; 100 of 100 under yosys 0.68 with the same rows; the timeout margin (slowest 3.53 s); the UG901
    cites of round 4's rows; nextpnr's `fasm.cc` lines 811-825; the corpus quotes of `53`, `54`, `57` and
    `75`; `81` and `26` reproduced; the guide's HTML equal to a rebuild; no names; the 25 corpus files with
    the course's `logic dp` line all read after `--fix-ports` except one whose module name starts with a
    digit (invalid anyway).
  - Not verified by them: what Vivado does with a typedef header included by two files, with `output logic
    Cout; reg Cout;`, and with a testbench that assigns a variable a DUT output drives.
- Round 6.
  - Designs that passed: `CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE FALSE` on a button clock; a CRLF XDC with
    `create_clock` (16 of the 37 corpus XDCs are CRLF); `create_clock` in a design with no `clk`; `const`,
    `union packed`, `unique0 case`, a default port value, `defparam`, `var logic`, an enum in arithmetic; a
    constant function without `return` (with it, the `16b` class); `initial if (N > 8) $error(...)` while
    false; an unconnected submodule input; a function reading a module variable in `always_comb`; vector
    bits driven from `assign` and `always_comb`, from two `always_comb`, from `always_ff` and `assign`;
    registered 16x16 and 32x32 multiplies (their timing is the DSP break above); negedge registers read by
    posedge ones (CLKINV); an ascending `[0:6]` port (13 corpus files use it); `$readmemh` with a Windows
    path (both stop with `design.sv:3`); a gated clock `clk & sw[15]`; the Table 21 math functions in
    localparams. A parameterized interface passed to a port builds right and fails in sim (`22`'s class);
    `initial q = $random;` stops with no `file:line` (`77`'s class); a top in two files is the known
    two-files class.
  - Corpus: 31 lab folders (41 roots) through `dewfpga bit` and `eqv.sh`: EQV PASS except the Gray counter
    and the dot-matrix project (both fixed this round), one empty stub and 12 skips (`38`'s class,
    redeclared ports). Testbench constructs `$urandom_range`, `$sformatf`, queues, dynamic arrays,
    `fork`/`join`, `wait`, `final` and `.name()` pass sim; `%p`, associative arrays and `std::randomize`
    fail in iverilog (0 corpus uses).
  - Mutations caught: memory words started at 1 (`28`), the data compare removed (`33b`). Equivalent or
    dead today: one edge's compare, LUT or RAM INIT `x` set to 1, the `INIT_` prefix, `upto`, the start
    delay, the `top` attribute (all 200 `x` INITs in the 57 product netlists are FDRE, FDCE, FDPE or LDCE).
    The newer testbenches (`41` to `88`, 18 read) each tell the construct from its obvious misreading.
  - The regression breaker: `bin/` and `templates/` equal to HEAD; 51 passed before, 148 with 77 gaps
    after; the corpus the same (the three folders whose error order differs also differ between two runs
    of the same CLI); 115 of 115 under yosys 0.68; the table's counts, the probe layout (one design file with
    `module top`, a `tb.sv` with `module tb`), the corpus logs of `08c` and `13d`, the UG901 rows of the
    round-5 probes, and the guide's HTML (equal to a rebuild) and PDF (13 pages) all hold.

**Tests.** `test/run.sh`: 51 passed, 0 failed before #2 (78 s); `passed 94, failed 0` after #2's first
draft (228 s). After break round 1: `passed 86, failed 0, known gaps 23` (356 s). After break round 2:
`passed 99, failed 0, known gaps 41` (305 s). After break round 3: `passed 119, failed 0, known gaps 56`
(409 s). After break round 4: `passed 138, failed 0, known gaps 63` (556 s). After break round 5:
`passed 148, failed 0, known gaps 77` (474 s). After break round 6: `passed 166, failed 0, known gaps 82`
(533 s; the final run of that round, 528 s, the same). After break round 7: `passed 178, failed 0, known
gaps 87` (583 s). The 178 are the 51 from before, 4 hygiene checks, 24 checks of the probe runner
itself, 54 checks of `eqv.py` and `eqv.sh`, and the 45 probes that are not known gaps (round 4: `63`
stopped being a gap and the 8 new probes were all gaps; round 5: of the 15 new probes, 14 are gaps and
`84` passes; round 6: of the 8 new probes, 5 are gaps, and `63b`, `91` and `92` pass; round 7: of the 9
new probes, 5 are gaps, and `31b`, `95`, `98` and `99` pass). The final run on 26 September, after these
notes were written: `passed 178, failed 0, known gaps 87` (582 s), the same (evidence below).
- `personal-path check sees test/sv/run.sh`: a home-folder path planted in a copy's `test/sv/run.sh` has to
  be found; `personal-path check sees test/run.sh` (round 7) plants one in `test/run.sh`, which the check
  skipped whole until then.
- `no names from student code in expect.tsv`: no quoted `module '<name>'`, `` `\name' `` or `(name_reg)`
  in the source column; `student-name check sees a quoted name` plants all three and has to find each
  (round 4 added the `` `\name' `` plant), and a quoted name after each of the pattern's 10 words (round
  6).
- The runner checks, each on a copy of the product with one thing broken, running one probe: a stale
  `top_sim` that prints `PASS` next to a broken `09` (the run has to say `rtl fail`); `05` recorded as
  refused under a yosys that is not the measured one (the run has to report a new silent wrong); `07`'s
  netlist recorded as failing (the run has to fail on the unexpected pass; only with the measured yosys);
  `26` with an empty source (refused); the CLI's latch error moved to line 1 (the run has to say
  `expect.tsv says design.sv:3, no stage printed it`). Round 2 added: `16c` broken so its testbench
  prints `FAIL` (has to be `rtl fail`); a probe folder with no row (refused); a `dewfpga bit` that exits
  0 and deletes `top.bit` (has to be `bit fail`); `01`'s column set to `not supported`, then
  `unverified` (both refused); `14` broken in the top finder, run through the runner and `test/run.sh`'s
  row check (the runner's row has to say `bad`, its exit code has to be non-zero, and the row check has
  to print `FAIL`); six hand-written rows (a `bad` row fails, and so do an `ok` whose stages differ from
  `expect.tsv`, an `ok` for a silent wrong, an `ok` for a supported probe that fails a stage, and an exit
  code that does not fit the rows; a clean row passes). Round 3 added, both under a yosys that is not the
  measured one: `07` with a netlist that differs from its RTL and a testbench that sees nothing (has to be
  `netlist fail, expected pass`), and `54` the same with its own testbench, where the comparison is
  skipped (the same); and a check that the runner checks write nothing to `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`. Round 4
  added: the score line counted again from two hand-written rows (the right line passes; each of four
  wrong numbers fails); the latch error's advice replaced (`01` has to say `expect.tsv quotes 'Give q a
  default value at the top of the block.', no stage printed it`); the CLI made to skip `.v` files (`74`
  has to say `expect.tsv says design.v:3, no stage printed it`). Round 5 added: the unnamed-instance fix
  replaced (`02` has to say `expect.tsv quotes 'Write:  inv u_inv(', no stage printed it`: a quote in
  `"..."`); `01`'s vivado column written `Supported` (refused as a malformed row). Round 6 added: `04`'s
  dual-edge advice replaced in the product (`04` has to say `expect.tsv quotes 'Drive each signal from
  one always block.', no stage printed it`: a row's second quote); `76`'s second `file:line` made wrong
  (`expect.tsv says design.sv:9, no stage printed it`); `07`'s bench made not to compile (`netlist fail,
  expected pass`: an `eqv.sh` exit 1 is a fail); and, with the measured yosys and iverilog, a
  hand-written `ok` row for `07` against a table that records its netlist as failing (has to `FAIL`).
  Round 7 added: `07`'s testbench made to call `$error` and still print `PASS` (`dewfpga sim` exits 1;
  has to be `rtl fail`); and, in the score check, a runner log with no score line and one that writes
  `Synthesis` (each has to fail).
- `eqv.py: ...` and `eqv.sh: ...` (54 checks): `test/sv/eqv_check.sh` with equal, `msb`, `zero`, `walk`,
  `cbutton`, `ones`, `dense`, `sparse`, `deep`, `button`, `zout`, `xout`, `init`, `fdse`, `ldpe`,
  `ldfill`, `lostinit`, `xstart`, `fillset`, `fillaset`, `pkenum`, `enum1`, `lostreset`, `recode`,
  `hier`, `hierfault`, `names`, `ioequal`, `ioread`, `iofloat`, `mealyb`, `xstarta`, `xstartl`,
  `fillasym`, `subreg`, `subfault`, `regport`, `regslice`, `alias`, `enum1sub`, `enumstart`,
  `memstart`, `datasw`, `nobench`, `pkgfile`, `nothing`, `romstart`, `mixstart`, `simflip`, `simlost`,
  `xhold`, `swreset`, `partassign`, `negset` (round 4 added 15 and changed `deep`, `button`, `xstart`
  and `recode`; round 5 added 7, and every case now runs the runner's own `eqv.sh`; round 6 added 11;
  round 7 added the last 6 and built the reset of `xstart`, `fillset`, `fillaset`, `xstarta` and
  `fillasym` from two switches).
- `unnamed instance -> line and fix` (one of the 51) now also looks for the fix, `Write:  sub u_sub(`;
  it looked for the line only (round 5).

The four stages today, before #3 and #4 change anything:

| | rtl | synth | netlist | bit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| pass, the 43 from 2509 | 35 | 32 | 27 | 32 |
| pass, the 51 after round 1 | 37 | 35 | 28 | 35 |
| pass, all 69 | 49 | 38 | 30 | 37 |
| fail, all 69 | 20 | 31 | 8 | 32 |
| not run (no netlist), all 69 | | | 31 | |
| pass, all 92 | 60 | 47 | 37 | 44 |

- The 43: synthesis 32/43, all four stages 24/43 (25 before the netlist was compared with the RTL; `03`
  moved), Vivado-supported probes passing all four 23/36.
- The 51 after round 1: synthesis 35/51, all four stages 24/51, Vivado-supported probes passing all four
  23/43, known gaps 24 (`13b` became supported in round 2: 23/42 and 23 before).
- All 69 after round 2: synthesis 38/69, all four stages 24/69, Vivado-supported probes passing all four
  23/60, known gaps 41.
- All 92 after round 3: synthesis 47/92, all four stages 26/92, Vivado-supported probes passing all four
  25/77, known gaps 56.
- All 100 after round 4: synthesis 52/100, all four stages 26/100, Vivado-supported probes passing all
  four 25/84, known gaps 63. (`63` moved from supported to unverified: 25/76 on round 3's 92.)
- All 115 after round 5: synthesis 57/115, all four stages 27/115, Vivado-supported probes passing all
  four 26/99, known gaps 77. The one new probe that passes all four is `84` (a constant `repeat`).
- All 123 after round 6: synthesis 62/123, all four stages 29/123, Vivado-supported probes passing all
  four 28/105, known gaps 82. The new probes that pass all four are `91` (a submodule in its own file)
  and `92` (a `$display` in a design module); `63b` fails where Vivado is unverified.
- All 132 after round 7: synthesis 69/132, all four stages 30/132, Vivado-supported probes passing all
  four 29/111, known gaps 87. The new probe that passes all four is `31b` (falling-edge registers); `95`,
  `98` and `99` fail where Vivado is unverified.
- The old runner (yosys called directly): synthesis 33/43, rtl 35/43, netlist 29/33.
- The 82 Vivado-supported probes that fail a stage are our gap (77 of 105 after round 6, 73 of 99 after
  round 5, 59 of 84 after round 4):
  - synth, yosys refuses: `01` latch in always_comb, `02` unnamed instance, `11` enum methods, `12b`
    assignment patterns, `12c` an array of structs indexed by a signal, `13b` unpacked array port, `13c`
    unpacked array concatenation, `16b` return, `16c` while loop, `22e` a modport expression, `23`/`23b`
    packages, `23e` a package that exports a name, `41` `==?`, `43` foreach, `44` do-while, `45` break,
    `47` type parameter, `49` default argument, `50` argument by name, `51` unpacked array localparam,
    `51b` packed 2-D localparam, `53` async reset with a synchronous clear, `56` a file-scope enum named
    `S0`, `60` pass by reference, `61` enum ranges, `62` the type operator, `64` an unpacked struct,
    `64b` an unpacked union, `65` a streaming target, `67` array equality, `68` an array slice, `69`
    disable, `82` `$fopen`/`$fdisplay`/`$fwrite` (UG901: Ignored), `83` `$realtobits`/`$bitstoreal`,
    `90` `$warning` in an `initial` parameter check,
    `85` a bitstream cast, `86` `extern module`, `87` a `config`, `88` a class's static function (`02`,
    `12b`, `13c`, `22e`, `51`, `51b`, `60`, `62`, `64`, `64b`, `65`, `67`, `68`, `83`, `85`, `86` and `88`
    fail rtl too);
  - the CLI's scanner stops sim and bit: `23d` header import, `40` a module named `display`, `40b` a
    module name and `(` inside a `$display` string, `57` a course module in netlist form, `78` UG901's
    keep_hierarchy attribute;
  - the CLI reads every file as SystemVerilog: `74` a Verilog-2005 `.v` file;
  - the CLI leaves a file out: `22b` interface file (rtl: iverilog syntax error; bit: yosys does not find
    the interface), `23c` package file (sim fails; bit builds a wrong bitstream), `56b` a file of
    file-scope typedefs (sim and bit stop at the first use, and neither names the file);
  - the CLI's top finder: `26`; its port-line fix: `08b`; its XDC check: `96` a one-bit vector port,
    `96b` a port numbered from 1;
  - place and route: `52` internal tristate (`$_TBUF_`), `33c` tristate buffers in submodules driving
    an output port (`$_TBUF_`), `70` wor/wand (`$and`, `$or`), `94` a variable base with a constant
    power (`$pow`);
  - timing: `75` misses 100 MHz; Vivado writes the bitstream, the CLI does not. `89` logic on a divided
    clock, which Vivado does not time: with no `create_clock` the CLI checks every clock at 100 MHz;
  - rtl, iverilog 13 refuses: `08c` a port with only a range written in an always block (`bit` writes its
    direction in, `sim` does not), `13d` a packed 2-D array indexed by a variable, then a bit or part
    select, `18b` unique if, `18c` unique0 if, `21b` an assignment inside an
    expression, `22` modport ports, `38` gate primitives driving `logic`, `54` a name used before its
    declaration, `71` a whole-array assignment, `72` a void function with outputs, `73` an array
    argument;
  - rtl, no UNISIM models in iverilog: `34` BUFG, `35` MMCM (`35`'s netlist too, no model in yosys'
    `cells_sim.v`);
  - netlist, no model in yosys' `cells_sim.v`: `97` UG901's `ram_style = "block"` (a RAMB18E1);
  - netlist (silent wrongs): the members of an interface instance used from the module that
    instantiates it, `22c` (with ports), `22d` (an array of interfaces), `22f` (no ports); `33` a pin
    the design sets to a constant `z` and reads (round 6: this said "inout read-back", but reading back
    a bidirectional pin works, `33`'s `JA[0]` and `33b`); `51c` a packed 2-D localparam whose type is a
    typedef (yosys builds the table as zeros),
    `58` a hierarchical name, `59` `$isunknown`, `81` a design module that calls `$finish` (the CLI takes
    it for a testbench and builds its submodule), `93` two roots, one named like its own file (the CLI
    builds that one, not the project's top);
  - `63` (`int'` of a real) was in the synth list until round 4 made it unverified.
- Silent wrongs, where the bitstream builds and the netlist fails: `03`, `03b`, `05`, `22c`, `22d`, `22f`,
  `23c`, `33`, `37b`, `39`, `51c`, `58`, `59`, `81`, `93` (15). They are #3's, except `23c`, which #4's
  package work closes. Two more rows build a bitstream whose netlist fails, `35` and `97`, for lack of a
  model, not because they are known to be wrong; the runner counts all 17 alike (round 7: these notes and
  the plan said 14 and left `35` out).

**Every probe.** The 132 folders of `test/sv`, from the final run's rows (they equal `expect.tsv`). Per
probe: the id, Vivado's status (`supported`, `not supported`, `unverified`), the verdict (`ok`: does what
the table says and is not a known gap; `gap`: a known gap), the stages that fail, the runner's note if any,
the construct, and where the Vivado status comes from. "Vivado 2020.1 log" is a Vivado log in a public
CS223 (or CS-224) lab repo or in the course's example project, quoted in `expect.tsv` without the
student's names; UG901 is the Vivado synthesis guide, UG953 the 7-series primitive guide. `expect.tsv`
holds the full quote for every source and what the student sees today. Summary: 45 `ok`, 87 `gap`; 111
supported, 3 not supported, 18 unverified.

```

**Does the suite catch breakage?** Each mutation below was made in a scratch copy and reverted.
- One bit of one LUT INIT flipped in the product's own netlists. Round 1's run drew 12 flips per probe
  with replacement (228 draws, some the same flip twice; its survivor list added up to 23, not the 24 it
  said). Round 2 drew distinct flips, 12 per probe or all a probe has, over the 30 probes whose netlist
  passes: 236 flips. The testbenches alone catch 101; round 1's `eqv.py` catches 171 and the new one the
  same 171; testbench and `eqv.py` together catch 209. Of the 27 left:
  - 6 are `55`'s, which has no `eqv.py` run (iverilog cannot compile its RTL, so only its testbench
    checks the netlist);
  - 11 are `10`'s, in LUTs that read the upper bits of its 32-bit `int` light (`l[27:24]`, `l[11:8]`, ...),
    which only ever holds 0 to 2;
  - 5 sit in combinational probes where the bench already compared every input: `16`'s 1 and `24`'s 2
    give the same outputs on all 65536 inputs, and `36`'s 2 are in the LUT that drives the kept net
    `mid`, which no output reads;
  - 5 are in clocked probes (`07`'s 1, `09`'s 1, `21`'s 2, `29`'s 1) and also pass a 65536-cycle run: LUT
    input combinations the design never reaches, read from the netlist, not proved.

  The new bench does not catch more of this sample; what it adds is shown by `eqv_check.sh` and by the
  breakers' flips (`21` at `sw = ffff` and at `7fff`), which the old one passed. Both are in the
  evidence below.

  Round 3 drew again, from `top.json`, 12 distinct flips per probe or all a probe has, over the 37
  probes whose netlist passes (25 of them have LUTs; this said 22 until round 4): 284 flips. The testbenches alone catch 154; round
  2's bench catches 199 and round 3's the same 199, so starting the netlist as the board does and
  counting `x` lost nothing here; together 253. Of the 31 left: 10 are `10`'s (its `int`, as above), 4
  `07`'s, 1 `09`'s, 2 `16`'s, 2 `24`'s and 2 `36`'s (as above: LUT input combinations the design never
  reaches, or a net no output reads), 4 `55`'s (all among the 11 of its 48 flips that do not change what
  its netlist does, see the break round), and 6 `75`'s. `75`'s testbench then checked 104 of the 16384
  values; it now checks every one, and on 60 other flips of `75` it catches 48 where the old one caught
  41. The 12 it passes cannot change a digit, because every value is compared.
- Source mutations of the 43 designs (one operator at a time, iverilog and the testbench): 113 killed, 42
  survived before; 122 killed, 32 survived after. The 32 left are listed under the break round.
- `--fix-ports` turned off: `08` fails, ``Module port `\dp' is neither input nor output``.
- `iverilog -g2005` in the sim rule (round 1, the 51): 37 of 51 probes fail. 36 fail at rtl: every probe
  whose rtl passes except `16c`, which is Verilog-2005 apart from `logic` and `'0`, and iverilog 13
  accepts those under `-g2005` with a warning. `22` fails because its rtl error moves from `design.sv:7`
  to `design.sv:1`.
- Every LUT's INIT set to 0 after synthesis (`setparam -set INIT 0 t:LUT*`), so the bitstream still
  builds (round 1, the 51): 19 probes fail, all at the netlist stage. The 9 other probes whose netlist
  passes have no LUT cells (INV, CARRY4, flip-flops, RAM, wiring).
- The runner itself: the five checks above. Forcing the runner's `exact=0` (the breaker's mutation) turns
  the unexpected-pass check red.
- Round 2, 15 mutations of the runner, `test/run.sh`'s row check and `eqv.py`, each on a copy of the
  fixed tree: every one turns at least one check red (list in the evidence below). Before round 2, each of
  the breakers' mutations here left the whole suite green.
- Round 3, 16 mutations of `eqv.py` and 4 of the runner, its checks and the port-line note, each on a
  copy: every one turns at least one check red (list in the evidence below). Before round 3, three of the
  breakers' netlist-stage mutations were caught by one probe, and only with the measured yosys (the
  comparison deleted: `03`; the testbench's `PASS` not required: `39`; no button presses: `03`), and four
  left the whole suite green (no exhaustive walk, no mostly-zeros values, a `z` counted as unknown, the
  port-line note one line down).
- Round 4, 17 mutations of `eqv.py`, each on a copy, against the 30 cases: every one turns at least one
  red (list in the evidence below). Before round 4, the breakers' `eqv.py` mutations (buttons out of the
  walk, pins never driven, pins not compared, 512 cycles) and their runner and check mutations (the
  score counted wrong, the latch advice replaced, `.v` dropped from the `file:line` pattern, the
  backquote dropped from the student-name pattern) each left the whole suite green. On the product's
  own netlists, a reset tied off in `09`, `10`, `21`, `31`, `32` or `34`: EQV PASS on round 3's bench,
  EQV MISMATCH now (each probe's testbench caught it already).
- Round 5, 8 mutations of `eqv.py` and `eqv.sh`, each on a copy, against the 37 cases, and 2 of the
  runner against its checks: every one turns at least one red (list in the evidence below). Before round
  5, each of the breakers' mutations left the whole suite green: no compare after the buttons change,
  async-reset flip-flops or latches not started, a reset value read in the other bit order, `flatten`
  dropped from the runner's register listing, the runner's `"..."` quote check and its vivado value check
  removed.
- Round 6, 12 mutations of `eqv.py` and `eqv.sh` against the 48 cases, 5 of the runner and `test/run.sh`
  against their checks, and 3 of the product or a probe against the probes: every one turns at least one
  red (list in the evidence below). Before round 6, each of the breakers' ones left the whole suite green:
  no start for a multi-bit enum or a memory, no data compare with a clock, `eqv.sh`'s bench guard, the
  `assigned_in` fallback, the packages-first order, the "nothing compared" fail, the runner's second
  quote, second `file:line` and exit-2 test, `sv_rows` always lenient, the name check cut to `module`,
  `sim` compiling one design file, `$print` kept for place and route, `44` read as a while loop.
- Round 7, 8 mutations of `eqv.py` against the 54 cases and 3 of the runner and `test/run.sh` against
  their checks: every one turns at least one red (list in the evidence below). Before round 7, the
  breakers' ones each left the whole suite green: the `x` test dropped from the sim-start excuse,
  `STARTS_AT_1` without `FDSE_1` and `FDPE_1`, the rtl stage's exit code not required, the score line
  not required, a home-folder path in `test/run.sh`. `13d`'s LUT INIT flips: 414 of 432 caught (308
  with the old testbench, the breaker's count), and the 18 left change nothing (above).
- Not caught: every LUT INIT stripped from the FASM before `fasm2frames` (the breaker's mutation): the
  bitstream loses its logic, and only the golden blink FASM, which is written before that step, is
  compared. See "Tried, and dropped".

The same new checks run against the tree before this round: the old personal-path grep misses the
planted line, student names FAIL, stale top_sim FAIL (the run said "rtl pass"), new silent wrong FAIL (the
run said "note: ..." and exit 0), empty source FAIL, latch line FAIL. The unexpected-pass check passes
there too: it guards the runner's exact mode, which was already right.

The breaker's LUT flip in 30's netlist (32'd2720070586 -> 32'd2686516154); the old testbench printed PASS:

The runner checks on a copy of today's tree with the breakers' runner mutations:

  enumstart memstart datasw nobench pkgfile nothing mixstart as expected (they pin what round 5 already did)

eqv mutations on a copy of today's tree, and the cases that go red (48 cases; none without a mutation):

  13 memories not started                              memstart

  assigned_in reads whole lines, not columns           alias enum1sub
On round 5's tree the breakers' seven (12 to 23) each left all 37 cases green.

Runner mutations on a copy of today's tree, the old checks that could see them, and the new one:

Product and probe mutations, the probe that goes BAD:

  delete t:$print dropped                    BAD 92_display_in_design   bit fail, expected pass   (no Bels remaining of type '$print')
  44's two do-while loops written as while   BAD 44_do_while_loop       rtl fail, expected pass
Before, no probe could see the first two (only 57 has two design files, and the CLI stops it; 40, 40b
and 81 never hand their $display to yosys); the breakers' full runs with them: passed 144, failed 0.
44 with its one loop written as while matched expect.tsv (gap, 1/1).

```

**Not verified.**
- CI has not run this tree: the main session pushes it. Under CI's yosys the probes were checked with the
  YoWASP build of 0.68 (a scratch venv, Homebrew untouched), not the Homebrew bottle `0.68+post` that CI
  installs. `63b` crashes yosys 0.69+post and stops at an internal cell check under YoWASP 0.68; what the
  bottle does is not known, and the row quotes neither, so it holds either way.
- No board was plugged in during #2, so `dewfpga flash` was not run; `35_mmcm`'s bitstream in particular
  was never tried on a board.
- What Vivado does with the 18 unverified probes (`03`, `03b`, `04`, `05`, `37`, `37b`, `39`, `46`, `48`,
  `55`, `63`, `63b`, `66`, `77`, `80`, `95`, `98`, `99`): no Xilinx document or corpus log settles them;
  `04` and `05` have only forum sources.
- Which top Vivado picks by itself when two modules qualify and the project names none: the two corpus
  projects of `93`'s shape name theirs. How Vivado names the pins of a one-bit vector port (`96`): no
  corpus source uses one; the row rests on the guide and IEEE 1800.
- `97`'s block RAM, and a `rom_style = "block"` ROM, on a board: never flashed; that the netlist stage
  cannot check them is by construction (no model), not a sign they are wrong.
- Things the breakers tried whose Vivado side no source here shows: a typedef header included by two
  files, `output logic Cout; reg Cout;`, a testbench that assigns a variable a DUT output drives, a
  non-constant `$clog2`, two `assign`s to one wire.
- Which of the two synthesis runs in the course example project's log `57`'s bitstream came from.
- The two corpus designs whose netlist differs from the RTL only through registers the RTL leaves `x`
  (round 3): judged start-value artifacts, not proved cycle by cycle.

**Not done here.**
- The top finder on `26`, the constructs the probes record (now 82 Vivado-supported failures, `56b`,
  `90`, `94`, `96` and `96b` among them), and the XDC's `get_ports` wildcard and list forms: #4.
- The silent wrongs, `03`, `22c`, `22d`, `22f`, `37b`, `39`, `51c`, `58`, `59`, `81` and `93` included,
  the untimed DSP48E1 paths and block RAM (`97`), a module defined in two files, and the missing
  rebuilds: #3.
- The messages of `12c`, `33c`, `40b`, `52`, `53`, `70`, `77`, `80`, `85`, `94`, `95`, `98` and `99` (and
  the "with -nobram every memory becomes LUTs" of the "does not fit" message, false for `97`), iverilog's
  `repeat` warning (`84`), the awk program printed on a yosys crash (`63b`), two `assign`s to one `wire`, and the
  async-reset rule's advice for `80`: #5. The plan called that rule dead and had #5 delete it; the plan
  now says it is live (`80`), so #5 fixes its advice instead. (The guide's sections 7 and 8 now say what
  the CLI does today; #5 changes what it says.)
- `75`: Vivado writes the bitstream when timing fails; `CLAUDE.md` records "timing FAIL = hata". Which one
  wins is the owner's decision, and #4 is where it lands, with `89` (a divided clock checked at 100 MHz).
- A test that looks inside the bitstream, the garbled and the internal clock names on the pnr line
  (`31b`'s falling-edge clock too), and a Vivado-style testbench without `$finish`: #6.
- `dewfpga sim` with two design roots naming `dewfpga bit` in its advice: #12, with top selection.
- README, README.tr and the cli page still say "46 checks". #6 locks the number.

### #3 · Silent wrongs stop the build · 26–27 September

**In numbers.** A silent wrong is a design that builds a bitstream and does not do what the simulation
showed: `expect.tsv` rows with bit=pass and netlist=fail. Before #3: 17. After: 2 (`35`, an MMCM, and
`97`, a block RAM: their netlists have no simulation model, the circuits are right). Of the 15 others, one
became right (`33`, a PMOD pin tied to `'z` and read back) and 14 stop with an `ERROR` that names the
student's file and line and says how to fix it; no `.bit` is written. Three probes that used to fail now
pass all four stages (`26` an array of instances, `33`, `56` a file-scope enum), so the Vivado-supported
probes passing all four stages went 29/111 → 32/111 and all four stages 30/132 → 33/133 (one probe added,
`95b`). Synthesis 69/132 → 57/133: the silent wrongs now stop there. Known gaps 87 → 79. `test/run.sh`:
178 passed before, 187 passed, 0 failed, 79 known gaps after (9 min 10 s). `dewfpga bit` on the blink example: 4.6 s before,
4.1 s after (three yosys runs instead of one: a preprocessor dump, elaboration, synthesis; measured once each, warm).

**What the student sees.** `test/sv/39_undeclared_name` (a typo, `summ` for `sum`), `dewfpga bit`, before:
```
design.sv:4: Warning: Identifier `\summ' is implicitly declared.
Warning: Wire top.\summ is used but has no driver.
pnr ok: 0 LUT, 0 FF, no clocked paths, timing not applicable   (full log: top.log)
top.bit  2.2 MB
exit 0
```
after:
```
design.sv:4: Warning: Identifier `\summ' is implicitly declared.
ERROR: design.sv:4: summ is not declared anywhere and nothing drives it: yosys made it a 1-bit wire stuck at x and built the design without it (dewfpga sim refuses this code). Declare it, or check the spelling (a typo of a declared name).
exit 2
```
`05_two_block_driver` (one register written from two always blocks) printed 22 lines of yosys warnings and
`top.bit  2.2 MB`, exit 0; now, after the first warning:
```
ERROR: design.sv:3 and design.sv:4: cnt is written from two always blocks (design.sv:3 and design.sv:4). Drive each signal from one always block: yosys resolved the conflict to a constant, so the board would not do what the simulation showed.
```
and no bitstream. `93_two_roots_file_name` (the plain counter and the board's top in one file named
`counter.sv`) built the plain counter, `counter.bit  2.2 MB`, exit 0, without a word; now:
```
ERROR: 2 modules could be the top (nothing instantiates them): counter, top. Name it:  dewfpga bit counter
exit 1
```

**What changed, one mechanism per class.** Product files only: `templates/Makefile` (111 → 252 lines),
`templates/check_xdc.py` (192 → 318), `bin/dewfpga` (162 → 164).
- *Undeclared and unresolved names* (`39`, `58`, `22c`, `22d`, `22f`). yosys warns `Identifier ... is
  implicitly declared` with the file and line, then builds a 1-bit wire with no driver. `-noautowire` was
  tried first and dropped: it also refuses the legal implicit nets of `76` (a port connection `.y(w)`, a net
  declaration assignment; IEEE 1800-2017 6.10). Now a plain implicit name is an error only when yosys then
  says nothing drives it; a dotted name (`u_fsm.state`, `c.q`) is an error unless its prefix is an
  interface port (`22_interface_modport` keeps building: yosys warns for those while parsing and resolves
  them in `hierarchy`). The message tells an interface member from a hierarchical name; the interface one
  says "not supported yet (#4)".
- *Two always blocks writing one register* (`05`), and a register written by an always block and a
  continuous assign. yosys' `multiple conflicting drivers` warning names cells, not lines, so the recipe
  now runs yosys twice: `read_verilog; hierarchy -top; proc; write_rtlil top.il`, then `read_rtlil;
  synth_xilinx ...`. The awk reads the cells' `src` attributes from `top.il` and prints both lines. A
  conflict whose drivers have no always-block line (two assigns to a tri bus, `52`) is left to nextpnr's
  verdict as before.
- *Async load from a signal* (`03`, `03b`). yosys emulated it with FFs and a mux ("Async reset value ...
  is not constant!") and `03b`'s netlist was a combinational loop. Any `$aldff` cell left after `proc` is
  now an error with the always block's line and the fix (load with the clock, or reset to a constant). A
  reset branch that loads a parameter or a localparam still builds.
- *`$isunknown` in a design* (`59`). yosys folds it to 1; on the board it is 0. Looked for in the code
  yosys' preprocessor hands to the parser (`read_verilog -ppdump`), so a `/* */` comment or an
  `` `ifndef SYNTHESIS `` block does not trigger it (the first version scanned the raw text and refused both;
  break round 1 found it). `` `file_push``/`` `file_pop`` in the dump keep the file and line of an `` `include``.
- *A module with ports that calls `$finish`* (`81`) was taken for a testbench, so its submodule was built
  as the whole design (`counter.bit`, exit 0) and `sim` printed nothing. A testbench is now a module with no
  ports; `$finish`/`$stop` in a module with ports stops sim and bit at that line (Vivado ignores it, UG901
  Table 21; yosys stops on it, #4 makes it ignored). Under `` `ifndef SYNTHESIS `` it is allowed (round 2).
- *Two modules that could be the top* (`93`). The file-name tie-break is gone, and so is sim's
  "prefer the root a testbench instantiates": sim and bit give the same answer, and stop naming both. The
  `.xdc`-name preference stays and is printed (`top module: X (named by the .xdc)`).
- *A declaration initializer that reads inputs* (`37b`, `logic [3:0] sum = sw[3:0] + sw[7:4];`). yosys
  takes it as the power-up value; the LEDs never follow the switches. The scanner stops at the line and
  prints `assign sum = ...`. A constant from a `parameter`/`localparam` of any type is a legal start value
  and builds (round 1 found `localparam int STEP` refused; fixed); a register with such an initializer gets
  the register-style fix (load it under its reset).
- *A module defined in two files* (`95b`, new probe: `lab4.sv` and a backup `lab4_old.sv`). Stops naming
  both files and lines. Vivado column: unverified (no log of that case in the corpus).
- *A package the tools were not given* (`23c`, `pkg.sv` next to `design.sv`). The CLI hands iverilog and
  yosys the files that hold a module; a package file is left out, iverilog stops at a syntax error and yosys
  drops the import and builds every name as an undriven wire. A source scan before either tool names the
  reference's line, the file that declares the package and the fix (`` `include "pkg.sv" ``); a package
  declared in a module file that sorts after its user (`zz_util.sv`) is now read first (round 2).
- *A typedef of a 2-D packed array* (`51c`, `typedef logic [3:0][6:0] tab_t;`) used for a parameter or a
  net: yosys keeps the value flat and `SEG[i]` picks a bit instead of a row, silently. Stopped at the
  declaration, with the flat `+:` rewrite yosys accepts; the scan reads `` `include``d files first (round 2).
- *An inout tied to `'z` and read back* (`33`). yosys kept the constant z as the pin's driver and the read
  gave z. A z-only driver drives nothing: it is dropped from the elaborated design (`top.il`), and the pin is
  read like a read-only inout. The netlist now equals the RTL (`EQV PASS: 78674 output bits`).
- *Stale rebuilds* (found in #2, rounds 1 and 2). `top.json` and `top_sim` now depend on the `.mem` files
  named by `$readmem`, the files named by `` `include``, and a `.deps` stamp of the file list, so an edited
  ROM, a changed include, a deleted or renamed testbench and a dropped design file rebuild. Measured with
  scratch folders before the change: each printed "up to date" or ran the old binary.

**Tried and did not work.** `-noautowire` (above). yosys `check -assert` for the two-block case: it also
counts the "no driver" warnings legal designs print. `connect -unset` for the `'z` pin: it rewires the read
too and the LED reads x. A first `.mem` grep pattern with a literal `(` broke make 3.81 ("unterminated call
to function `sort`"). Parsing `top.il` in the awk's `BEGIN` block read an empty file (the pipe starts awk
before yosys writes it); it is read lazily now. `hierarchy -check` in the elaboration run refused the UNISIM
primitives (`34` BUFG, `35` MMCM: "not part of the design"); the check is the synthesis run's, which has the
cell library. The first two-block rule fired on `52`'s tri bus with "(line unknown)"; a conflict without an
always-block line is not this error.

**Break rounds.** Two, each a student (up to 10 new designs against the claim) and a regression reader
(the diff, the 31 protect probes, the legal neighbour of every new rule), then a fix agent per task and an
integration; then a judge was added to the script for the next updates (this run was made before it). Round
1: 9 reports, 8 in scope (constant start value from `localparam int` refused; `$isunknown` in a block comment
and under `` `ifndef SYNTHESIS``; an interface port on its own line refused; the typedef scan firing on a
comment; `import pkg::*` reported as a typo; always_ff + assign printing "(line unknown)"; sim's two-roots
message saying `dewfpga bit`). Round 2: 5 reports, 5 in scope (the typedef scan missing an `` `include``d
`.svh`; `$finish` under `` `ifndef SYNTHESIS``; a package file sorting after its user; a struct member taken
for a type name; a second "(line unknown)" line in a submodule). All reproduced and fixed, each with the
legal neighbour re-run. Held in both rounds: undeclared names in a `.v` submodule, hierarchical names two
levels deep and into a generate block, two `always_ff` on the same edge in a parameterised submodule, an
active-low async load in a `.v` file, `$isunknown` in an included function, start-value spellings in `reg`,
typedef'd and parameterised forms, two roots across `.v` and `.sv`, two `always_ff` writing different bits of
one vector (builds), a reset branch loading a parameter (builds), dotted names of a packed struct (builds).

**Tests.** `test/sv/run.sh` on the 16 target rows: each row's stages and its `today` quotes were rewritten
to what the product prints (the runner fails a quote no stage printed). Two runner checks changed because
the product changed: "a new silent wrong fails with any yosys" plants its wrong row on `97` (it used `05`,
which the product now refuses), and the personal-path scan skips the gitignored `.claude/` folder (the
workflow's worktrees live there). The full suite ran three times in the main session: the first run found the
`34`/`35`/`52` regressions above and the `26`/`56` gains; the second failed only on `22b`'s stale quote (its
message changed: the interface scan now reads every `.sv` in the folder, not only the module files, so an
interface in its own file is classed as an interface, and the row quotes what yosys then prints); the third
is the line quoted in the numbers.

**Found and left to later updates.**
- #4: interfaces used from the instantiating module (`22c`, `22d`, `22f`) and hierarchical names (`58`)
  compile; `$finish` in a design ignored as Vivado does (`81`); `59` `$isunknown` as 0. `12b`'s named
  assignment pattern refused by iverilog and yosys (the judge-less round 2 hit it). `52`/`70`'s cells.
- #5: `22f` prints 32 "no driver" warnings after its three ERRORs; the ERROR for `39` prints before the two
  warnings it is derived from; `26`'s and `58`'s messages have no error code yet; the sim message for two
  roots says `dewfpga bit <name>` (it works for sim too).
- #6: the `.deps` stamps and `top.il` are new build outputs (`dewfpga clean` removes them; a student's
  `.gitignore` does not know them); a stray `.svh` not `` `include``d but declaring a 2-D typedef of the same
  name as a 1-D one would trip the typedef scan (no probe has it); `.mem` and `` `include`` dependencies are
  one level deep.
- Not verified (DOĞRULANMADI): whether Vivado orders a package file before its user on its own (UG901 does
  not say; the product now orders it); Vivado's exact behaviour on `39` (no corpus log; the message states
  the IEEE rule).

**Orchestration, for the record.** One workflow: 3 build agents in their own worktrees, one integrator,
2 breakers × 2 rounds, up to 3 fix agents per round, 14 agents in 3 h 0 min, then the harness killed the
last integrator (a 20-probe run is silent for more than 3 minutes; it had already applied both fixes).
Lessons written into the script: at most 5 probes per call, fix agents copy the integrated product into
their worktree first (each spent 10 minutes discovering that their worktree was at HEAD), one scratch folder
per agent (two overwrote each other's repro), a judge with a reproduced criticism before the close.
